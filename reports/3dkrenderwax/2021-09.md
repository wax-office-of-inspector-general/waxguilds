# 3Dk Render WAX Guild - September 2021 Report

## Technical Operations

### Full History API:
Our Hyperion cluster is not yet operational. During the reindexing process it has suffered some problems that have forced us to restart the process from the beginning.

### Atomic API: 
Our Atomic API is working with a redundancy and availability configuration consisting of 2 ship nodes and 2 other API nodes behind a load balancer. However, we have detected problems of momentary loss of synchronization, so we are studying the extension of the service by means of a cluster for PostgreSQL. It is possible that the delays are due to the formation of bottlenecks due to the high demand of requests.

Until we can improve availability, we are forced to limit connections to 10 requests per second to ensure a more democratic use and to prevent large consumers from collapsing the service.

### Block Producer nodes: 
After last month's update of the nodeos version, no more empty blocks have been detected on the production nodes in the mainnet from our nodes.

### Testnet:
Our block producer and Full History API service on testnet continue to operate normally. Our team is making constant use of the Full History API node during the development and testing of our upcoming video game Rada Quest.
Product Development

## Product Developmet

### Rada Quest (Trading Card Game)
The release of the first beta of the Rada Quest tcg game should be ready for this September but is delayed to October due to the need for further testing of the smart contracts for opening packs and merging NFTs. These smart contracts are self-developed and its technique will be exposed in future publications in our blogs, as usual.

We plan to add a new developer to the 3DK Render team from October and hope to accelerate the development of our projects.
Community and Marketing

## Community Engagement
The development of the Rada Quest videogame and the implementation of the new Hyperion cluster has not left much time for new publications but we thought it was very important to share an article talking about how the mutable data of an NFT (AtomicAssets) can be modified. The article covers the technique needed to make the modifications both from JavaScript and from a smart contract. A Spanish and an English version have been published.

We continue to provide technical support and tips for WAX application development from various public Telegram channels and our Discord, especially in Spanish-speaking channels like https://t.me/waxio_es.

We have our main character from Rada Quest game, "Arianna", as part of pixel art in Token Girls Guardians pack sale:
