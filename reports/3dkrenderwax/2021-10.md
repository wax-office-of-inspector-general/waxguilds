# 3Dk Render WAX Guild - October Report

## What is the name of your Guild?
3dkrenderwax

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Our Full History (V1) server on testnet showed some problems so it has been updated to version v2.0.13wax01. After the update its behavior is proving satisfactory so we plan to upgrade the Mainnet nodes to the same version of Nodeos.

We've added a dedicated full history ship node to our Hyperion cluster. It is currently completing the cluster reindexing process.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

During the last months all our efforts are focused on the publication of the first beta of the game Rada Quest TCG. A problem has arisen with the system of opening packs so we have been forced to delay the release by a few weeks.

The game uses its own smart contract for opening packs and merging NFTs.

The Rada Quest pack system works with premint and its smart contract is designed to periodically add new packs with new content. It is a very dynamic system and can be useful for other collections.

The testing phase is already very advanced (on testnet) and advertising will be deployed on social networks in the coming days.

We are also waiting to organize our software development branch through the constitution of a video game company (Dungeon Keeper Studios S.L.) The legal process began a few weeks ago and we hope to be able to officially announce it in a few days.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

We have published a tutorial explaining how singleton tables can be used from a smart contract. To illustrate the text we have created a dapp whose usefulness is to burn all the NFTs that are sent to it.

- The dapp is available for use on the "totheburning" account

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
