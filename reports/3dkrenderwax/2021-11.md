# 3Dk Render WAX Guild - November 2021 Report

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

In this month of November our public service based on Hyperion has completed its synchronization and begins to offer service at full capacity. In the fight against spam and abuse, we are having problems with the adjustments of the ranges of requests per second. Currently the server has configured a ratio of 30 maximum requests per second.

On November 16 our DNS provider (Nominalia) suffered a crash in its entire system. This made it impossible to access any of our services or websites except the production nodes. As soon as we were able to access the DNS management system, we migrated to a new provider. We have chosen Cloudflare because of its better rating by other professionals. While we set up the change some of our services suffered sporadic interruptions.

On November 28th our main producer node failed. Although we were able to quickly switch to one of our backup nodes we could not avoid losing 84 blocks during the process. The failure was caused by a hard drive problem. Throughout the day the node was repaired and put back into operation.

Due to the constant increase of requests against our APIs we continue to work on expanding the number of nodes, especially peers and query APIs.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

On November 12 we released the beta of our game Rada Quest TCG. The release was accompanied by the sale of a serie of NFT packs, as we announced in the previous guild report.

**Drop sale:** https://wax.atomichub.io/drops/84872

**Game site:** https://game.radaquest.net

**Game Whitepaper:** https://radaquest.net/whitepaper


This pack serie consists of an edition of 6500 units. Currently 1720 packs have been sold. We have not been able to coordinate our publication schedule with the availability of advertising on AtomicHub. We are currently managing advertising in WAX Cloud Wallet and with NFTHive. 

The sale of packs is done from Atomic Hub but the opening of the packs and the blending of shards is done in-game.

- 1300 player accounts have been created to date. 
- Players can earn rewards as tokens by participating in the Gems minigame as well as the daily login event.
- Game Art NFT holders (versions created by GrisVisa only) are receiving Soul Crystal tokens daily.
- We have opened market in Alcor for the Soul Crystal token. Soon we will tokenize the rest of the game's resources and open their respective markets.

**Next stage**

Our team is already working on the next phase of the game. This will include:
- First edition of game cards
- Upgradable building resource generation system
- System for boosting and blend game cards

This stage will be fundamental to give context to the economy of the game. The tokens that players are generating from the first stage will be needed to upgrade buildings and game cards.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We are in the first weeks of releasing the beta of our game so we have been focused on the attention to users and the resolution of problems and bugs that have arisen mainly from our Discord server. In the coming weeks we will resume writing new technical tutorials.

At the same time, we have continued to collaborate with other community projects through our community manager Cristalla and from our social networks:
