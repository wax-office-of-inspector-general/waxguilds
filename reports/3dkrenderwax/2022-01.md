# 3Dk Render WAX Guild - January 2022 Report

## Technical Operations

We have extended our service on testnet with a new public Atomic API.

- https://testatomic.3dkrender.com
- http://testatomic.3dkrender.com

We have also enhanced our mainnet contribution with two new services.

- Full peer node: https://query.3dkrender.com:9880
- Account query: https://query.3dkrender.com

## Product Development

We continue to focus on the development of our main project, the strategy and collectible card game Rada Quest.

Main page: [radaquest.net](https://radaquest.net)
Game site: [game.radaquest.net](https://game.radaquest.net)

The project is still in its first phase, but it is already a project in which it is interesting to participate in order to prepare for the next phases.

The first phase also includes a daily reward system and a stake reward system. 

![Daily reward](https://3dkrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wp-14-e1642092254305.jpg)

The stake reward system is based on a fixed daily amount plus a % of the profits the game earns per payout on the token itself. At this stage only the daily fixed pot is being distributed as the Soul Crystal is not yet used for in-game currency purchases.

We hope that this will allow players to accumulate tokens for card boosts in the next phase. You can see how this process will work and the costs involved in this process in our whitepaper. With our card boosting system we are confident that the economic system of the game will be sustainable and beneficial in the medium to long term.

Although Rada Quest is still at a very early stage, we have already passed the threshold of 1800 players. 

More than 8400 matches have already been played in the weekly Gem mini-game championships (since 12 November). This is the ranking of the most active players.

We are now working on the implementation of Rada's social system. Players will be able to join Guilds that can be created by the owners of the game lands. They will form the main system of production buildings and resource generating elements (FTs).

This is a UI preview:

# Documentation, tutorials and source code

We have enthusiastically welcomed the WAX documentation project. We would like to participate by providing updates and more source code examples. We would also like to create a branch of the documentation translated into Spanish. In the next few days we hope to get organised to start the work.

**WAXCANNER - a tool to track NFT purchases and sales**

Continuing with our interest in helping the WAX development community we have published the code of a program that performs a blockchain sweep, filtering transactions by markets and obtaining a list of purchases and sales.

To add more utility we have incorporated in the code a system of calls to an exchange to be able to express the amount of the purchase or sale in WAX, USD and EUR according to the value at the time of the action.

Our first objective has been to show the code as a use case and example of how to implement the solution in JavaScript. The system of calls, both to the WAX API and to the exchange API, makes it very easy to implement in other languages, such as Python.

Our second objective is to create a public UI on web so that non-technical users can obtain a CSV with their transactions. This is still work in progress.

**Improving the "totheburning" smart contract**

We publish the "totheburning" smart contract to show an example of the use of singleton tables in WAX. The smart contract burned all the tokens it received via transaction.

It only worked with Atomic tokens but we have extended the code to work with SimpleAssets tokens as well.
