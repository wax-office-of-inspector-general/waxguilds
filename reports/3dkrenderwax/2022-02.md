## Blenderizer

Blenderizer is a smart contract designed to gamify NFT collections. Its fundament is to reduce the number of NFTs in a collection by burning several units to obtain a new NFT of higher rarity.

These are the usage statistics for the last 6 months (February incomplete added)

| Month     | NFT Burned | NFT Minted | New Blends Created | Collections | Unique Users | Total Actions |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| August    | 526,654    | 94,065     | 3,407              | 328         | 5,705        | 908,859       |
| September | 554,045    | 139,526    | 4,868              | 310         | 6,272        | 1,120,069     |
| October   | 178,239    | 45,093     | 722                | 222         | 2,770        | 361,438       |
| November  | 1,049,808  | 245,986    | 1,899              | 290         | 8,276        | 2,252,534     |
| December  | 512,915    | 134,702    | 1,897              | 267         | 7,102        | 1,101,211     |
| January   | 303,847    | 68,276     | 1,912              | 273         | 4,697        | 731,598       |
| February  | 266,178    | 57,005     | 1,364              | 275         | 5,139        | 536,459       |

**In the previous evaluation Blenderizer was marked as "on decay" so we would like to add an observation:**

Blenderizer is an [open source project](https://github.com/3dkrender/Blenderizer) thanks to which many collections and games are offering more usage options to their collectors and players. Thanks to being open source, many collections are creating their own custom modifications according to their gamification criteria. We believe that the use of Blenderizer will decline in favour of the new projects that, with its code as a base, will appear in the community. That is why we ask that Blenderizer be considered as an impactful contribution to the WAX NFT community, not as a privately developed product that, as we have explained, will lose usage and, therefore, score. We are very committed to the community and we like to share source code from our projects but we will not do so if it harms us in this way.

## Rada Quest TCG

We continue to focus on the development of our main project, the strategy and collectible card game Rada Quest.

- Main page: [radaquest.net](https://radaquest.net)
- Game site: [game.radaquest.net](https://game.radaquest.net)
- Game (testnet): [gametest.radaquest.net](https://gametest.radaquest.net)



**Wiki**

We have implemented a Wiki on the official website of the game and we are adding all the necessary documentation to know all the details of the project.

- NFT Collections
- Events
- Tutorials
- Gameplays 
- etc.

![Rada Wiki](https://3dkrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wiki_01.jpg)


**Usage statistics**

The game is still at a very early stage. Currently players can perform these actions:

- Receive daily rewards for login
- Opening packs
- Mixing shards to get collectible NFTs 
- Playing the Gems game (Jewelry type) 

According to dappRadar, Rada Quest ranks 26th in the WAX games category by number of users in the last 30 days range.

These are some of the statistics that we have elaborated from blockchain transactions:

| 11        | 100            | 998          | 22.25   |
| 12        | 81             | 793          | 24.70   |


**New Releases**

On 26 February the new version has been released with new features in the game:

- The game account pays for the CPU of player transactions.
- An exchange system is implemented between the players' internal wallet and their WAX wallet.
- The weekly Gems tournaments incorporate a new category system according to the final score. Thanks to this system, players can be grouped according to their scores in similar leagues.
- The Discord game bot service has been improved.

**Next Goals**

We are working on the development of the next targets:

- System for generating resources from upgradable buildings.
- System for upgrading playing cards.

This will be a very important phase in the game as the usability of the generated resources (FTs) as consumables to upgrade cards will be the pillar of the game economy.

We are aiming for this phase to be released in April 2022.

When this phase is released it will be accompanied by the sale of the first set of playing cards.

## WAX-Development Documentation

During the month of February we have developed a dynamic system to convert the WAX-Develop documentation portal into a multi-language site.

Thanks to this system it is very easy to create translated documents and have them automatically indexed. 

Our next goal is to complete the translation of the site content into Spanish. For this purpose we have qualified staff as translators who will be assigned a minimum of 5 hours per week.
