# 3Dk Render WAX Guild - April 2022 Report

# Technical Operations

We are upgrading our mainnet producer nodes. Due to the problems we have seen over the last few months in maintaining a sufficiently fast response in block verification, we have opted for more powerful servers (Intel i9-12900K).

The result has been very satisfactory as can be seen in the graph.

We continue to offer our infrastructure on Testnet:

We are working on adding new features to the smart contract Blenderizer.

- Random results through mergers
- Incorporation of FTs
- Web interface

Roadmap:
Modifications to the smart contract will be ready in May 2022. We are making a round of contacts to hire more developers to create a new user interface for Blenderizer and its new features.

## Rada Quest TCG

We continue to face delays caused by the failure of the CPU co-payment system. Our efforts are focused on the next release which will include the basic resource production and building improvement system.

In the meantime, players continue to participate in weekly mini-game tournaments through which they can accumulate useful in-game tokens as well as win prizes in WAX.

- Daily Average Users: 174.2
- Monthly Unique Users: 429
- Minigames played: 3103 

We have collaborated with several Twitch channels from communities coming from other blockchains, such as BSC, who are joining the WAX gaming ecosystem with the intention of raising awareness of Rada Quest and showcasing the viability of gaming projects on our blockchain.

The official Twitter game account continues to grow in audience and engagement:

## Discord Bot

We have started a project to create a bot for Discord. One of its first functions is to publish as a channel name the updated WAX prices (every 10 minutes). Currently the price of WAX is displayed against USDT, ETH and BTC.

![discord_bot](https://3dkrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DiscordBot01.png)

We are currently making a round of contacts to add another developer to the team whose dedication will be the development of this project. The functions that the bot will incorporate will include:

- User verification
- Subscription alerts
- Wallet management (FTs and NFTs)
- Contests
- and more...

We cannot set a goal timeline until we have hired the new developer.

## WAX Arena

We have hired a new developer to join the WAX Arena team. Thanks to this addition we are working on a complete redesign of the project.

During the last few months we have chosen to keep a low profile with this application due to the maintenance issues it has presented. We are very excited to be able to relaunch this project with new and improved ideas.

Urgent goals:

- New user interface.
- NFTs loading optimization.
- Performance improvements and bug fixes.

Next goals:

- New features and functions for working collections as a set.

Rodmap

- Launch of the new interface: 2Q 2022
- New features for collections: 3Q 2022

# WAX Strategic Contributions

With over 5,000 unique users per month, over 300,000 NFTs burned per month and over 700,000 transactions per month we consider Blenderizer to be a tool that thanks to the gamification of collections has brought a great impact to the NFT ecosystem on WAX.

Its main advantage is its compact design in a fully autonomous and functional smart contract that allows it to be used from any third party application.

Hundreds of collections use Blenderizer to gamify by offering new models of rarer and scarcer NFTs in exchange for destroying lower rarity ones, which helps to facilitate scarcity and improve collection economics.
