# 3Dk Render WAX Guild - July 2022 Report

# Technical Operations

We have not implemented significant changes to our infrastructure during the last period.

As producers, we suffered a loss of 15 rounds. Our failover system failed to perform a successful exchange to another of our booster producer nodes due to an error in its configuration. 

This loss has meant that we have lost our position in the top 21 producers. We accept the decision but consider that in the current economic market situation, coupled with the massive increase in WAX Blochain transactions in the last 12 months, with the resulting overload on the infrastructure of the BPs, the availability ratio required of the BPs is excessive.

We continue to offer our infrastructure on Testnet:

- Seed node: testnet-p2p.3dkrender.com:9876

# Product Development

## Rada Quest Game

As I mentioned in the previous point, given the difficulty of staying in the top 21 and with a bearish market, the viability of our Rada Quest project may be our only chance to survive this period and continue working for WAX Blockchain. That is why we have concentrated all our efforts on getting the new version of the playable beta out as soon as possible.

The new version of the game is available on testnet for final testing. We have added new features:

- Card boosting -> https://radaquest.net/whitepaper/#boostinggamecards
- Card recycling (burn for tokens) -> https://radaquest.net/recycling-playing-cards
- CPU Stake for players for the amount spent in the in-game shop (up to 1000 WAX) for a period of 30 days.

CPU cost has always been a concern for players and also for us as developers. We believe we have implemented a really useful system for our players who will see their CPU consumption capacity increase thanks to their in-game purchases.

Even though our game is still at a very early stage, we have detected a strong use of multi-accounts to abuse our daily reward system. We have informed our players that from 1 September they will need to be an active player to continue receiving these rewards. Only players who own any NFT from our Game Art series or have a minimum of 1000 units of our Soul Crystal token in their in-game wallet will be considered as active players.

Rada Quest is double-verified on AtomicHub and this week we have also been double-verified by NeftyBlocks.

The release of the new beta on mainnet will be during the first week of August. It will be accompanied by the sales campaign for the first set of game cards.

We are coordinating the publicity with the WAX ambassador network.

We are also in contact with Flame, a new multi-chain gaming platform, to feature Rada Quest in their catalogue of games. 

We are presenting some demonstration videos to the community. For now they are in Spanish. We will also publish demo videos in English.

We believe that Rada Quest is one of the most underrated products in the WAX community but we hope that the new updates will help us break this losing streak.

# FundingWAX (Discord bot)

FundingWAX is a Discord bot that will serve to connect the Discord user community with their WAX accounts.

We have added new features to our Discord bot. Here is the current overview:

- Verify and associate WAX accounts and Discord account.
- Move WAX and any other tokens from the WAX wallet to the internal Discord wallet.
- Make payments or deliver tips in Discord using WAX or any other token. The recipient does not need to be verified to receive a payment, but must be verified to make a withdrawal to the WAX Blockchain.
- Discord channel participation rank system with role assignment.
- Creation of contests for participation with WAX token rewards.
