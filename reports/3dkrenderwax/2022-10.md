# 3DK Render WAX Guild - October 2022 Report

# Technical Operations

We have started a progressive upgrade of our services. We are currently testing the new versions of WAX-Leap and Hyperion on testnet.

- Hyperion testnet service (V3.1.4) (currently in indexing)
https://tapiwax.3dkrender.com

- Installing new SHIP nodes on testnet. V3.1.2wax01 (currently in indexing)

When the indexing of the new Hyperion service is finished we will proceed to terminate our History V1 service.

We continue to offer our infrastructure on Testnet:

- Block producer
- Atomic API: https://testatomic.3dkrender.com
- Full History: https://testnet-wax.3dkrender.com
- Seed node: testnet-p2p.3dkrender.com:9876

Although we are currently in the StandBy zone of the WAX Block Producers classification, we continue to offer our usual services on the WAX main blockchain.

# Product Development

## Rada Quest Game

Website: https://radaquest.net

The current situation of cryptocurrency prices, along with the atmosphere of pessimism typical of a bear-market era is not helping for the deployment of the Rada Quest game.

To this we must add the loss of revenue due to the fall from the Top Producers to the Standby zone, whose revenues barely cover the costs of the infrastructure required by WAX Blockchain.

Because of this we have been forced to reduce staff to ensure the continuity of the project although now the development may be delayed somewhat longer than expected.

We remain committed to the development of this project and continue to work towards its completion beyond the playable beta that is now deployed.

In this last period, the system of empowerment and evolution of game cards has been activated. Thanks to this system players can transform game resources into tradable tokens while controlling the stock of cards in circulation. In short, the resources obtained in the farm section are consumed to boost attributes of the NFTs which, when burned, will generate more or less tradable tokens depending on the amount of resources used in the process.

We are currently developing the PvP section, which will be ready before the end of the year.

This section consists of a card selection system to form lines of attack and defense.

We have been showing progress in our social channels, such as Discord

The social impact of the game has had some very good moments, as measured by GameFi, Game Verse or Beng Beng Gaming:

During this period we have only been able to make some minor corrections in the indexes of some sections, such as the management of NFTs with SimpleAssets.
