# 3DK Render WAX Guild - April 2023 Report

# Technical Operations

All 3DK Render nodes are upgraded to Antelope 3.1
- P2P nodes
- Producer nodes
- SHIP node
- Query node

Atomic API is upgraded to Antelope 3.1 (SHIP node) and Atomic V1.3.17

We have observed some problems in the OIG node viewer (https://oig.sentnl.io) regarding the availability of our Atomic API service. The service has been operating completely normally without displaying any warnings on other node monitors such as https://tools.ledgerwise.io or https://validate.eosnation.io. We thought it might be due to a too severe connection ratio control so we have softened the ratio. The OIG monitor alerts seem to have disappeared since the change.

Hyperion API is upgraded to Antelope 3.1 (SHIP node) and Hyperion V3.3.9-4

Our previous Hyperion service was showing availability problems. We have completely upgraded the hardware of all nodes (SHIP, Elasticsearch, Indexer and API) and the result has been very satisfactory. The availability problems seem to have disappeared and we are now ready for a FULL-Node presentation.


## Testnet:

We continue to offer all testnet services (Antelope 3.1)
- P2P nodes
- Producer nodes
- SHIP node
- Atomic API
- Hyperion API

# Product Development

## Rada Quest TCG

March saw the first PvP campaign in Rada Quest TCG.

Players have a limited number of free tickets to enter the Coliseum to face another player. Once the free tickets have been consumed they must purchase more tickets if they want to continue participating in the PvP.

The payment of tickets is done with in-game tokens, being one of the different use cases of tokens to provide value.

The second PvP campaign is already underway and will end on May 2nd. Campaigns will be held on a regular basis.

Here are some data for the month of March:

- Gems Mini-Game played: 7,110

- Unique players at Coliseum: 290
- Coliseum battles: 127,151
  - Victories: 90,282
  - Defeats: 36,869

- Coliseum tickets purchased: 47,070
*Soul Crystal paid: 395,700*

**Twitter**

**Referral program:**

During the month of March we have enabled the referral system that allows you to earn commissions on game tokens (currently 4% of purchases with Soul Crystal) thanks to the purchases of other players.

![Referral System](https://3dkrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/referralsystem.png)

**Next goals:**

- We are currently working on the Guild system so that players can group together and perform activities together and qualify for exclusive rewards.

- We will create a reward ratio system for the referral system.

- Thanks to the rewards of existing events and the consumption of specific resources in these events, players are beginning to see their token balances become unbalanced. For this reason, it is urgent to deploy a new building in the development system that allows transforming some tokens into others (with the consumption of resources in the form of fees that will help to give value to the tokens).

> The market situation has not improved much since the last few months and our position on the WAX producer list ranges from top 21 to stand-by so we are still limited in terms of personnel. The development of new game features is going on slowly but steadily.

## FundingWAX - Discord Bot

During this month we have resumed the development of our Discord Bot "FundingWAX" after being forced to stop its development due to the dismissal of the developers in charge of it.

Our current goal is to adapt the bot so that it can be integrated with gamification activities with WAX projects. We will start testing with activities that are linked to our game Rada Quest. We want to create a tool that dynamizes user communities around their favorite applications and games.

As a reminder, these are some of the functions already available in the bot:

- WAX-Discord account verification.
- Deposits and withdrawals of WAX tokens to Discord wallet,
- Sending "tips" (WAX projects tokens) between Discord users.
- Contests with WAX projects tokens as prizes.
- Ranking system by participation.
- Multi-Server support.

To Do:
- NFT management. Transfers, alerts, giveaways, etc.
- Integration with other WAX projects.

## TokensCrowd - WAX DAO Platform

There is nothing new in the development of the project. We are currently working on solving a problem with the end of the voting periods for community proposals. 

As part of the solution to the problem we have developed a simple block explorer to support transaction review. We have exposed this explorer in the WAX Developer portal documentation and have published an open source example in our GitHub repository.

## Blenderizer V2

We are aware that the new functions of the updated smart contract "Blenderizer" are hardly being used. For this reason we are studying the creation of our own web interface to facilitate these activities. 

We hope to bring updates on this project very soon.

# Ecosystem Development

## WAX Developer portal

As I mentioned, we have added to the WAX developer help portal an example of a simple block explorer. The program connects to a SHIP to receive, evaluate and act on information received on the blockchain blocks in real time.

The text is accompanied by example source code:

https://github.com/3dkrender/WAXCrawler

In response to the request to change the documentation system to another type of framework such as Vuepress I have been investigating different options. I have discarded Vuepress due to the outdatedness of its components. Among the possible alternatives I am leaning towards Docusaurus, a framework that combines React, markdown and extended markdown. It is widely used as a document framework by many projects in the crypto ecosystem. It not only has the document system of indexed pages; it also includes a landing page and blog system.

I am currently in the process of updating the documentation of our Rada Quest project with this framework. I believe that both the results of this change and the multiple examples of use that are on the Internet can serve to take this alternative as a viable option.

## Social Media

Great user retention and engagement on posts, making polls, questions, twitter threads and mini guides. We have had a lot of interaction from the community, as they share their anecdotes about their experience playing the coliseum. We have attended interviews interviews and more to promote the game.
