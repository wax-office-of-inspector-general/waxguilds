# 3DK Render WAX Guild - August 2023 Report

## Technical Operations

August has been a tragic month for our infrastructure. At the end of July, our Hyperion service began showing signs of malfunction. We worked on its tuning, but the entire cluster eventually collapsed and self-destructed, resulting in the loss of all information from the Elasticsearch nodes that composed it. Faced with these events, we made the decision to renew all the hardware to install a completely new and updated cluster. Due to this issue, our public historical query service was interrupted for two weeks, the time it took to prepare the new hardware and install the entire service.

Currently, since mid-August, the system is operating with full functionality and providing a FULL historical record.

On August 28th, we detected failures in the publication of DelphyOracle data by our Guild due to the exchange we monitor delisting the WAX-ETH pair. We have made necessary adjustments to recover the pair's information, and additionally, we have added the WAX-EOS pair.

We have also observed unusual increases in latency in the production nodes of the testnet. We are making changes to the configurations and testing the update on some of our testnet nodes to version 4.0.4.

We are continuing the usual services in testnet with Hyperion (full), Atomic API, peers, SHIPs, and producers.

# Product Development

## Rada Quest TCG

### Guild Section Development Update

We are continuing with the development of the guild section. Currently, we have completed 90% of the member management section:

- Searching for guilds
- Joining/canceling membership requests
- Approval/rejection of membership requests
- Leaving the guild
- Member expulsion

Our upcoming goals before a public release are:

- Guild shop (80% completed)
- Resource consumption commission management
- New building for resource exchange

As per our usual work approach, we have been waiting to have the guild section in a viable state of development before initiating the public sale of the NFTs associated with the guilds. During the month of September, we will begin with advertising and deploying these NFTs, which will be directly sold through the drop systems of NeftyBlocks and NFTHive.

We keep our community updated on our progress through our Discord and Twitter channels.

### Some stats

During the last two months, especially in August, we have observed a significant decrease in usage statistics. We believe this is a natural trend due to the time of the year when many people are on vacation, enjoying the summer season.

**NFTopia 3**

Our participation in NFTopia encompassed a robust calendar of activities for each day. Players, including new users, engaged with our events in an exceptionally positive manner. When assessing the impact, our participation rates were notably high. An Ask Me Anything (AMA) session was conducted on Cristalla's Twitch channel, offering insights into new aspects of the game and attracting new players.
A peek into our activity calendar:

**Wombat**

We have successfully integrated the Wallet Wombat with our game login. Work is underway to implement an activity tally within Rada, which will coincide with a collaborative event alongside Wombat. The aim is to attract new users from their platform to Rada Quest. More details on this will be provided in an upcoming report.

**Extra**

Additional noteworthy aspects include the sustained player engagement through casual events and other strategic tools.

## Client/Server WAX Template

Recap: This template offers all the software infrastructure to start a typical client/server application for a WAX Blockchain environment.

We have carried out a significant update on our public Github repository. The main changes are:

- **Replacement of UAL with WharfKit**
- Upgrade to React-Router v6
- Update of NextUI library to v2

https://github.com/3dkrender/WAX_CS_Template

Next goals:
Our next goal will be to expand the documentation and promotion of this tool. We believe it is of great utility for all those who want to start in the development of applications for the WAX Blockchain.

### Blenderizer

We are working on a portal that offers all the functionalities of our Blenderizer smart contract. Furthermore, considering the situation of Pink.gg and the uncertainty about the continuity of its services as a marketplace, we want to include all the necessary tools for the creation and management of NFTs from this portal.

The site is in a very early stage of development but already has some interesting features (available to the public):

- Display of collections with blends where the user holds any of the required ingredients in their wallet. Upcoming:
  - Creation of collections, schemas, and templates.
  - Blend creation.

![collections](https://3dkrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BlenderizerTools_01.png)

- Display of all available blends for the collection. Upcoming:
  - Blend execution.
  - Ingredient search for exchanging/buying.

![blends](https://3dkrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BlenderizerTools_02.png)

- Resource management. Users can view the token balance of their collection and their own wallet. Upcoming:
  - Sending/withdrawing tokens for the advanced blends in Blenderizer version 2.

As a demonstration, we have implemented a system for Rada Quest users that allows them to search for other users to exchange ingredients of the Game Art NFTs from the game. The system associates users based on the ingredients they need and have in surplus.

Note: *This tool is being developed using our Client/Server WAX Template.*
