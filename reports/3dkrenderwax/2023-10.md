# Product Development

## Rada Quest TCG

As is already known, due to the market situation, the possibilities of expanding staff are very limited, so the development of our applications and tools, in general, is much slower than expected.

The development of the new guild section is ongoing, and we have started private tests on the testnet with the help of some community volunteers.

However, we have been adding new improvements in other sections of the game

- Update session management to Wharfkit
- Wombat collaboration
- Bug fixes and improvements

### Wombat Collaboration

To participate in the collaboration, it is necessary to log in to Rada Quest TCG with the Wombat wallet, and upon completing certain daily game missions, a reward of an agreed number of Wombucks (Wombat's own token) is received directly in the users' wallets.

We just started the collaboration on November 12, so it's still early to show usage metrics.

We show some links of the announcements made to the community:

We believe this is an excellent opportunity to attract new users not only to Rada Quest in particular, but to the entire WAX ecosystem in general. The Wombat user community is more than 2 million users.

### Some Stats

As we expected, after the end of the summer the statistics of access for new users and return of existing users have increased significantly

**X (Twitter)**

Our social network X remains the focal point for our players, serving as their primary source for game updates and guides. We've observed a heightened appreciation among players for content focused on patch notes for each version and monthly game statistics. With our growing player base, we are dedicated to continually educating them on all available features.

Rada Quest continues to expand its influence, solidifying its position as a top game within the community.

### 3DK Render Social Media

**About Wombat Collaboration**

Following the integration with the Wombat wallet, our integration has been further enhanced with the addition of Wharfkit, which has proven to be a big hit with players. Thanks to an article published by us that explains how to claim ownership of CloudWallet wallets (mentioned in a previous point), many of our users have adopted Wombat without having to give up their old wallet.

Our collaboration remains ongoing, with further details to be provided in the next report.

### Cristalla

Throughout the month, we maintained our support for various projects, explored new games, and actively engaged in activities aimed at introducing the Blockchain to new users while educating existing ones about the latest ecosystem updates.

Cristalla is actively contributing with NFTopia and now as a staff, She has a increase in her Twitch stream viewership. Her Twitter threads within the X social network have also garnered significant anticipation among her followers.

# Some notes from us

We are closely following the conversations and proposals about a possible new tokenomic system. Unfortunately, we do not have the experience and knowledge about this complex matter to be able to provide more value than what members of other Guilds are providing.
