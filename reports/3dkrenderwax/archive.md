### Atomic APIs

Due to problems with the Atomic API we had deployed, we have performed some infrastructure upgrades as announced last month:

- Upgrade to the latest API version
- Deployment of 2 API servers (public and private)
- API nodes and WAX state history nodes are located on separate servers in each case. 4

### Hyperion APIs

As we have done with the atomic API, we want to separate and duplicate the Hyperion API. We are awaiting the delivery of a new server to deploy a second API. At the moment we have 2 servers with WAX state history and 1 server for the API.

Public API: [https://apiwax.3dkrender.com](https://apiwax.3dkrender.com/)

Private API: in progress...

### Blenderizer smart contract

We believe that the Blenderizer smart contract has been of great use to the community. Thanks to Blenderizer, great projects like NFT-Blender, NeftyBlocks or Blenderizer-Watch have emerged. We have received many requests for collaboration for the creation of custom blending systems and we have been able to collaborate with some of them, such as GrimFolks.

Due to the growing interest, we believe that the best way to help this project grow is to release the source code of the smart contract. With this move, we hope that many more projects will join the game of mixing and burning NFTs.

Blenderizer code source:

### Rada Quest TCG

During the last week we have started the testnet testing phase of the first modules of the game. Access to the tests is free but we try to manage it from our Discord server to coordinate the process.

Thanks to games like Alien Worlds we have been able to evaluate the impact that a high number of transactions can have on the blockchain, so we are redesigning the NFT update system to reduce transactions as much as possible.

### 

### WAX Arena

We have made small improvements to facilitate the indexing of NFTs by category and to correct some errors in the location of NFTs in the user's inventory.

## April 2021

## Technical Operations

The Atomic API servers are suffering such an overload that they are not able to synchronize their database at the working speed of the blockchain. For this reason, we are setting up a new server that is more powerful than the previous one. We intend to offer 2 Atomic API servers to guarantee availability.

Actual Atomic API node (in replay due sync lost)

*[https://atomic.3dkrender.com/atomicassets/docs](https://atomic.3dkrender.com/atomicassets/docs)*

- Intel® Core™ i7-8700 Hexa-Core Coffee Lake
- 128 GB DDR4 RAM
- 2 x 1 TB NVMe SSD

New Atomic API node (in replay)

*[https://atomicapi.3dkrender.com/atomicassets/docs](https://atomicapi.3dkrender.com/atomicassets/docs)*

- Intel® Core™ i9-9900K Octa-Core Coffee Lake
- 128 GB DDR4 RAM
- 2 x 1 TB NVMe SSD

The main block producer is suffering from abnormal load peaks and block losses in the last weeks so we have decided to increase the number of private p2p servers that can guarantee its stability. These operations will be carried out throughout May.

## Product Development

We have started the deployment of the **Rada Quest game** on testnet. This deployment will be done progressively to test the different elements of the game.

We intend to announce the sale of game NFTs packs when we can release an MVP on mainnet.

**Phaser-WAX integration template**

We have developed a public template to facilitate the adoption of HTML5 games created with the **Phaser** framework on WAX Blockchain. This template provides a basis for starting a Phaser game integrated with the UAL library.

https://github.com/3dkrender/phaser3-WAX-template

## Ecosystem Development

The smart contract **Blenderizer** is proving to have a great impact on the community. Its use is constantly increasing thanks to the interfaces that have been developed for it, such as https://nft-blender.com and more recently https://neftyblocks.com.

*Blenderizer allows generating new NFTs after delivery and destruction of other NFTs agreed between the parties and configured in the smart contract. It is specially designed for the gamification of collections and stock control.*

## Community and Marketing

**Discord**

Our community has grown by 42% with more active members against the last month (400 users last month / 682 now).

We have been making community events to make our community grown and teach them about WAX, one is the initiative "3DK Render WAX Academy" to make a live weekly podcast in our discord podcast channel easily teaching them what is WAX and its ecosystem.

## Product Development

3DK Render is immersed in several application development projects on WAX Blockchain:

**WAX Arena**. This project was released on 20th, December 2020. It is a system of gamified auctions. Unlike traditional systems, in WAX Arena the bidders who are outbid get small benefits as commissions.

- Service and Value for WAX community: WAX Arena is not another auction site. The gamified system with commissions when overbid makes this project more attractive for users and will help to increase the NFT flow.
- Milestones:
    - Auction site deploy: December 2020
    - To-Do (1T-2T 2021)
        - Blenderizer integration.
        - Drop system to mint NFT by demand.
- Metrics: WAX Arena has several tracking tables for active and completed auctions as well as commissions collected for authors for the resale of NFTs. It also has a table with the transaction history of the creation of auctions and bids.
    - Smart contract tables (waxarena3dk1):
        - arenaconfig: total authors balance
        - activebids: Active bids, duration, date, bids count per auction, commissions to bidders, authors, amount to seller.
        - hbids: Bid history. Same as activebids but auctions finished.
        - history: Transaction history to track auctions creations and bidds.
        - userbal: Tracking total sell/total buy by user.

**Blenderizer**: Blenderizer: This project is designed to mobilize large NFT portfolios based on offering added value to existing NFTs. Creators can offer their clients and followers the opportunity to obtain more exclusive assets in exchange for burning existing assets.

- Users can set a list of base NFTs to send to the smart contract and a NFT whitch will be minted to send to the user when bases have burned. The ultimate goal of this application is to increase the value of existing NFTs by reducing their number through burning.
- At the moment this project is only available as a smart contract, without UI. We plan to incorporate this system into the WAX Arena project. The original Blenderizer project will remain available to users for free, just like now.

    - blenders (blenderizerx smart contract table): list of blenders created

**Rada Quest TCG**: Rada Quest is a multiplayer and free-to-play online trading card game with real-time stretegy and building system. It's still in development stage.

Two years ago I started with the design and development of the Rada Quest project at Steem Blockchain. The difficulty of developing a smart contract over Steem led me to look for alternatives and that's how I knew WAX, a perfect ecosystem for NFT-based games.

- This is the biggest project I am engaged in. Both the illustrations (almost all of them) and the game code are created by Marcos DK, owner of 3DK Render Guild.
- This project aims to attract players to the WAX Blockchain ecosystem. I also intend to attract collaborating artists who want to exhibit their creations as trading cards (NFTs).
- Milestones:
    - 1T 2021: First beta will be released with limitated functions:
        - Upgrade and combine trading cards
        - Building basic system
        - Basic Market
        - 1 mini-game with tournaments.
    - 2T - 3T 2021: Battle card system
    - 4T 2021: Quest system

## Community and Marketing

I have worked as a teacher of information technology since I finished my studies in 1994. I have also published programming articles in Spanish magazines and tutorials for all levels.

My contribution to the WAX community is the creation of original and didactic content for Spanish community about smart contract programming or dApps on WAX Blockchain.

My most recent article:

[Usando JavaScript para acceder a los índices secundarios en las tablas de un smart contract en WAX](https://3dkrender.com/tutoriales-wax-tablas-secundarias)

In the previous months I have written several articles (in Spanish) about dApps programming to access Simple Assets and Atomic Assets smart contracts among other topics. Some of those articles can be found in the 3DK Render blog or in the EOS Barcelona blog, with whom I maintained a temporary collaboration.

Besides the creation of technical documentation in Spanish, there is also in my roadmap the creation of Discord Bots. I hope to bring news about it during the next months.

My YouTube channel has over 450 subscribers and I have posted video tutorials about blockchain technology and video games development. My priority objective in the channel will be to focus on WAX Blockchain.
