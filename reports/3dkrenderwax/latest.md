### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

We are in the process of changing our full Hyperion API to a partial API. We have encountered some issues with the behavior of Redis in Hyperion version 3.3.10, so we are continuing with the full version of Hyperion while we work on the partial version with Hyperion version 3.5.

We have worked on solving some problems in our IPFS server that were causing some availability issues.
