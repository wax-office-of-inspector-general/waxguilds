## Technical operations
* We successfully completed infrastructure patching.
* We resolved an SSL issue on the tgg domain.

## Ecosystem development
We have focused more on WAX this cycle with a lot of community engagement on socials, the promoting of Creators First initiative, as well as working with Alien Worlds. Most popular WAX article was on the Unity SDK (https://tokengamer.io/wax-releases-sdk-for-unity-with-cloud-wallet-integration/) and we're working on an interview with Lukas Sliwka.

## YouTube
We are currently working on a new content strategy for YouTube, with more highly tailored content, but have continued to see modest views and subs in the interim.

## Podcast
Mint One is continuing in the same vein: we're growing month-on-month and attracting great guests, exposing other ecosystems to WAX. Listen Notes, the #1 podcast database, now has Mint One as a top 10% podcast globally.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
Not at this time.
