## Technical Operations Updates

We believe we meet all Technical Operations criteria.

We have spent a lot of time this month troubleshooting Hyperion issues and expanding our Hyperion cluster. Our new Hyperion 3.3.4-rc6 cluster is approximately 1-2 weeks from being fully synced.

## Community Engagement Updates

We continue promoting and engaging with WAX community members on our [Discord](https://tokenhead.io/discord) server and [Telegram](https://t.me/tokenheadio) channel. 

While the primary focus of our social channels is to engage with members about our app, it has also served as a place for general WAX and NFT discussion. NFT creators are also using the channel to promote their products.   

We participate in the WAX community channels (TG & Discord) supporting and assisting users during launches as well as many general cases. We have also been consistently engaging with users in the Funko channel on the WAX discord.
