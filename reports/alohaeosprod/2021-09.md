## Community Engagement Updates

We continue promoting and engaging with WAX community members on our [Discord](https://tokenhead.io/discord) server and [Telegram](https://t.me/tokenheadio) channel. 

While the primary focus of our social channels is to engage with members about our app, it has also served as a place for general WAX and NFT discussion. NFT creators are also using the channel to promote their products.   

We participate in the WAX community channels (TG & Discord) supporting and assisting users during launches as well as many general cases. We have also been consistently engaging with users in the Funko channel on the WAX discord.
