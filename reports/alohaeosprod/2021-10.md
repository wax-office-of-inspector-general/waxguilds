## Ecosystem Development Updates

On October 19th, 2021 we launched a new NFT drop platform called [Droppp](https://droppp.io) which is available at https://droppp.io. We also did our first drop on Droppp with [Funko's Fantastik Plastik Series 1 part 1 mini-drop](https://digital.funko.com/drop/6/fantastik-plastik-1/238). We sold out of 10k packs in approximately 30 minutes. Today we are doing part 2 of the drop. Going forward we will continue using Droppp for Funko NFT launches.   

On September 30th, 2021 we launched the [Funko X Iron Maiden Digital Pop! Series 1 collection](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/maiden.funko). This collection sold out in approximately 30 minutes with a total of 24k packs.

## Community Engagement Updates

We continue promoting and engaging with WAX community members on our [TokenHead Discord](https://tokenhead.io/discord), [Droppp Discord](https://droppp.io/discord)  and [Telegram](https://t.me/tokenheadio) channel. 

While the primary focus of our social channels is to engage with members about our app, it has also served as a place for general WAX and NFT discussion. NFT creators are also using the channel to promote their products.   

We participate in the WAX community channels (TG & Discord) supporting and assisting users during launches as well as many general cases. We have also been consistently engaging with users in the Funko channel on the WAX discord.
