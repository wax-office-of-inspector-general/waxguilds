### Droppp

- URL: https://droppp.io and https://digital.funko.com
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Analytics: 
  - Droppp has created around 85,000 WAX “*.dp” accounts (verifiable on chain), and we only do this for users who either pay (USD) for an account or for a pack during a drop, so bots are near nonexistent.
  - All of our collections combined have done about 21,000,000 WAXP in secondary sales to date (verifiable on chain), which have contributed about 420,000 WAXP to the WAX DeFi tokenomics pool.
- Spec Document: Not applicable.
- Code Repo: Private
- **News / Updates**:
  - Since the last update we had two additional NFT drops ([Retro Comics](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/rcomic.funko), [Nickelodeon Cartoons](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/ntoons.funko)), which both sold out in under 30 minutes and brought in many new users to WAX.
  - We also had a very successful promotional email drop with Funko, specifically for onboarding more accounts to Droppp and WAX.
  - Redesigned our Inventory page with better filtering and more asset detail stats.
  - Ongoing work with our redemption system for shipping physical products. Shipping starts very soon.
  - Improved backend pack opening scaling for a better experience during our drops.
 
### TokenHead
 
- Description: Mobile app to track and showcase your digital collectibles.
- URL: https://www.tokenhead.io

- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Analytics: We are seeing consistent TokenHead app usage, with an average of 48,000 API calls per day over the last six weeks.
- Spec Document: Not applicable.
- Code Repo: Private
- **News / Updates**: Our focus has mostly been on scaling and maintaining the backend infrastructure (Hyperion + custom ingestion), which has been challenging with all the WAX network growth.

We continue promoting and engaging with WAX community members on our [TokenHead Discord](https://tokenhead.io/discord), [Droppp Discord](https://droppp.io/discord), [Telegram](https://t.me/tokenheadio) channel.   

Below are the analytics for the last 28 days from our [TokenHead Twitter page](https://twitter.com/tokenheadio)

While the primary focus of our social channels is to engage with members about our drops and apps, it has also served as a place for general WAX and NFT discussion. NFT creators are also using the channel to promote their products.
 
We participate in the WAX community channels (TG & Discord) supporting and assisting users during launches as well as many general cases. We have also been consistently engaging with users in the Funko channel on the WAX discord.
