## Technical Operations Updates
 
We believe we meet all Technical Operations criteria.   
 
We launched a new public Hyperion cluster that is publicly available at https://api.wax.alohaeos.com.

We have provisioned new API and SHIP servers with 256G of memory preparing for the increased memory demands of the chain. 
 
## Product Development Updates
 
### Guild Benchmarks
 
- Description: Network tool used for measuring CPU execution performance of guilds.
- URL: [Charts](https://www.alohaeos.com/tools/benchmarks#networkId=11&timeframeId=4), [Data](https://wax.bloks.io/account/eosmechanics)
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Analytics: N/A.
- Spec Document: Not applicable.
- Code Repo: Partially open source. The mechanics contract and execution scripts are open source, and the data is open on chain, but the collection and charts are private.
- **News / Updates**:
  -  Ongoing monitoring & maintenance of the tool and data.
  -  The eosmechanics WAX account ran out of CPU so we staked additional WAX to keep the benchmarks running. 
 
### Guild Reliability Tracker (Website and Telegram bot)
 
- Description: Tools used for measuring the reliability of WAX Guilds and for notifying users of reliability issues on Telegram.
- URL: [Website](https://www.alohaeos.com/tools/reliability#networkId=11&timeframeId=10&sort=rank&sortDir=asc), [Telegram](https://t.me/WAX_Mainnet_Aloha_Tracker)
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Analytics: N/A.
- Spec Document: Not applicable.
- Code Repo: Private
- **News / Updates**: Ongoing monitoring & maintenance of the tool and data.
 
### Droppp
 
- Description: NFT drops and market for fans and collectors of pop culture and Funko’s new home for Digital Pop!™ Collectibles.
- URL: https://droppp.io and https://digital.funko.com
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Analytics: 
  - Droppp has created around 85,000 WAX “*.dp” accounts (verifiable on chain), and we only do this for users who either pay (USD) for an account or for a pack during a drop, so bots are near nonexistent.
  - All of our collections combined have done about 28.9 million WAXP (2,018,252 since last update) in secondary sales to date (verifiable on chain), which have contributed about 579K WAXP to the WAX DeFi tokenomics pool.
- Spec Document: Not applicable.
- Code Repo: Private
- **News / Updates**:
  - Since the last update we have had two additional NFT drops ([Transformers](https://droppp.io/drop/27/transformers-series-1/) and [Scooby-Doo](https://droppp.io/drop/30/scooby-doo-series-1/)), which both sold out in under 30 minutes and brought in many new users to WAX. Scooby-Doo was our largest sale to date both in gross sales and participants.   
  - We partnered with an iconic comedy club in Los Angeles ([The Comedy Store](https://thecomedystore.com/)) to host special [NFTs celebrating their 50th anniversary](https://shop.comedystore.com/pages/anniversary-nft). Guests attending their event were given physical cards at the door that had claim codes for one of two NFTs. These NFTs come with access to special events, seating, discounts, and more.   
  - The improvements we made to the Droppp backend to allow for more concurrent pack openings was evident during the Transformer and Scooby-Doo drops as users were able to immediately open after purchase and we did not have to rate limit pack openings at all.
  - With the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle physical Pop! from our first Funko NFT release having arrived in recipients homes, we have completed the first full cycle of an NFT sale, redemption, and delivery. Very exciting seeing so many users share their unboxing experiences on social media including a number of OG's in the WAX community. 
  - Completed a number of small tweaks and fixes to the inventory and collection tracker.
 
### TokenHead
 
- Description: Mobile app to track and showcase your digital collectibles.
- URL: https://www.tokenhead.io
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Analytics: We are seeing consistent TokenHead app usage, with an average of 48,000 API calls per day over the last six weeks.
- Spec Document: Not applicable.
- Code Repo: Private
- **News / Updates**: Our focus has mostly been on scaling and maintaining the backend infrastructure (Hyperion + custom ingestion), which has been challenging with all the WAX network growth.
