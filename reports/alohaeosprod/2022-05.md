## Technical Operations Updates
 
We believe we meet all Technical Operations criteria.   
 
We significantly reduced the rate limiting on our public Hyperion cluster.

We deployed additional 256G PUSH API and SHIP servers.

We deployed a new mainnet backup producer node in the US East region that mirrors the hardware in the primary producer node.   
 
## Product Development Updates
 
### Guild Benchmarks
 
- Description: Network tool used for measuring CPU execution performance of guilds.
- URL: [Charts](https://www.alohaeos.com/tools/benchmarks#networkId=11&timeframeId=4), [Data](https://wax.bloks.io/account/eosmechanics)
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Analytics: N/A.
- Spec Document: Not applicable.
- Code Repo: Partially open source. The mechanics contract and execution scripts are open source, and the data is open on chain, but the collection and charts are private.
- **News / Updates**:
  -  Ongoing monitoring & maintenance of the tool and data.
  -  The eosmechanics WAX account ran out of CPU so we staked additional WAX to keep the benchmarks running.
 
### Guild Reliability Tracker (Website and Telegram bot)
 
- Description: Tools used for measuring the reliability of WAX Guilds and for notifying users of reliability issues on Telegram.
- URL: [Website](https://www.alohaeos.com/tools/reliability#networkId=11&timeframeId=10&sort=rank&sortDir=asc), [Telegram](https://t.me/WAX_Mainnet_Aloha_Tracker)

### Droppp
 
- Description: NFT drops and market for fans and collectors of pop culture and Funko’s new home for Digital Pop!™ Collectibles.
- URL: https://droppp.io and https://digital.funko.com
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Analytics:
  - Droppp has created around 105,000 WAX “*.dp” accounts (verifiable on chain), and we only do this for users who either pay (USD) for an account or for a pack during a drop, so bots are minimal.
  - All of our collections combined have done about 40.4 million WAXP (11,470,779 since last update) in secondary sales to date (verifiable on chain), which have contributed about 807K WAXP to the WAX DeFi tokenomics pool.
- Spec Document: Not applicable.
- Code Repo: Private
- **News / Updates**:
- We released Collection Tracker 2.0 for Droppp. Now it's even easier to see just how close you are to that prestigious Royalty Set with improvements we've made to the discoverability of missing assets in your collection! We've also enhanced the Full Set page and renamed it to Catalog. Catalog now shows nearly every collectible asset in a collection, including packs. Use Catalog as a way to easily fill in missing gaps in your collection, view the number of duplicates you have of a given NFT, and as a quick way to jump to the secondary market.
 - Since the last update we have had two additional NFT drops ([DC x  Funko Series 1](https://digital.funko.com/drop/39/dc-series-1) and [Kellogg’s x Funko Series 1](https://digital.funko.com/drop/41/kelloggs-series-1)), which both sold out in approximately 30 minutes and brought in many new users to the WAX ecosystem. DC was our largest sale to date both in gross sales and participants.   
- On May 18th, 2022 we completed the Retro Comics x Funko Series 1 redemption snapshot and opened redemption for qualifying items.
- On May 20th, 2022 we completed the redemption window for Bob Ross x Funko Series 1.
 
### TokenHead
 
- Description: Mobile app to track and showcase your digital collectibles.
- URL: https://www.tokenhead.io
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Analytics: We are seeing consistent TokenHead app usage, with an average of 48,000 API calls per day over the last six weeks.
- Spec Document: Not applicable.
- Code Repo: Private
- **News / Updates**: Our focus has mostly been on scaling and maintaining the backend infrastructure (Hyperion + custom ingestion), which has been challenging with all the WAX network growth.
