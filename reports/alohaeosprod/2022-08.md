## Technical Operations Updates
 
We believe we meet all Technical Operations criteria.   
 
Over the last week there have been issues on chain affecting transaction processing. We performed an analysis and tested various settings to hopefully help mitigate the issue. We also created a method to auto greylist potential chain abusers that we may use when necessary.

- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Analytics:
  - Droppp has created over 131k WAX “*.dp” accounts (verifiable on chain), and we only do this for users who either pay (USD) for an account or for a pack during a drop, so we believe that most if not all are real accounts (vs bots).
  - All of our collections combined have done about 59.3 million WAXP (28.7 million since last update) in secondary sales to date (verifiable on chain), which have contributed about 1.7 million WAXP to the WAX DeFi tokenomics pool.
- Spec Document: Not applicable.
- Code Repo: Private

- We added the ability for users to view any WAXP they may have sent to their .dp address and a way to transfer it out to another WAX address.
