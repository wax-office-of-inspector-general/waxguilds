## Technical Operations Updates
 
We assisted with troubleshooting the WAX chain service disruptions that occurred on Nov 28, 2022 and conversed with fellow guilds on Telegram.   

Due to various timeout issues users were experiencing when using the tools on the Aloha website we migrated to a new more powerful DB backend configuration. Since the migration we have not received any reports of further timeout issues. We are also working on additional improvements to increase the speed and responsiveness of the website and tools.
