After 11 long months and lots of hard work, we are happy to finally reveal that we have partnered with Funko to bring their vast catalog of IP to the WAX blockchain. You can read the official press release here: [https://investor.funko.com/news-and-events/press-releases/Press-Releases/2021/Funko-Enters-NFT-Market-with-Majority-Stake-in-TokenHead-Developer/default.aspx](https://investor.funko.com/news-and-events/press-releases/Press-Releases/2021/Funko-Enters-NFT-Market-with-Majority-Stake-in-TokenHead-Developer/default.aspx).

## September 2020

## Technical Operations

We have set up a public snapshot service at [https://snap.wax.alohaeos.com](https://snap.wax.alohaeos.com/). These are filesystem level snapshots and include full blocks and state history, which we think is a nice addition to the existing nodeos snapshot services out there. We also submitted a pull request to add “snapshot_endpoint” to bp.json ([https://github.com/eosrio/bp-info-standard/pull/30](https://github.com/eosrio/bp-info-standard/pull/30)) and included it in our own json ([https://www.alohaeos.com/wax.json](https://www.alohaeos.com/wax.json)).

We believe we meet all Technical Operations criteria.

**Updates:**

- We have added another API server to our load balancer to accommodate growing traffic demands.

## July 2020

Below are updates for our July evaluation.

## Technical Operations

We believe we meet all Technical Operations criteria.

**Updates:**

- We have completed the setup of a new Hyperion v3.1 cluster ([https://api.wax.alohaeos.com/v2/health](https://api.wax.alohaeos.com/v2/health)), with better failover redundancy and capacity than our previous endpoint.
- We coded, tested, and proposed a change to DelphiOracle to allow rank >30 guilds to call the write action, showing their readiness to the OIG.

Our support staff continues to offer assistance to community members on Telegram. Below are examples from the [WAX.io](http://wax.io/) channel.

- Assisting users with the staking process
- Guiding users on how much to stake to CPU vs. NET
- Helping users link their WAX accounts with Scatter
- Assisting users with accessing the WAX web wallet
- Answering user questions on WAX related topics. For example, “What does NFT mean?”

None at this time. Keep up the good work!

## February 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

Our public API now supports v1 and v2 history using Hyperion, and we now pass all history checks in the EOS Nation Validator ([https://validate.eosnation.io/wax/producers/alohaeosprod.html](https://validate.eosnation.io/wax/producers/alohaeosprod.html)). We are continuing to build out our Hyperion infrastructure with increased availability and redundancy.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

We continue to maintain all of our tools on WAX, of which several are open source.

We expanded the block metrics in our WAX Guild Reliability Tracker ([https://www.alohaeos.com/tools/reliability#networkId=11&timeframeId=8&sort=rank&sortDir=asc](https://www.alohaeos.com/tools/reliability#networkId=11&timeframeId=8&sort=rank&sortDir=asc)) and added charts for missed rounds and blocks over time.

Given that both our Reliability Tracker and Benchmarks tools are used regularly to help monitor the health of the network, including being utilized by the OIG in the guild evaluation process, we feel this shows the importance of these tools as “staples” and strengthens the justification for a 4 rating.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Geographic Distribution?**

We have added a backup producer node in Warsaw, Poland. This supplements our backup production in France and our primary production in Hawaii, US. The changes are reflected in our wax.json and on chain in the producerjson contract. At this time we believe we meet all Geographic Distribution criteria.

## January 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

We are contributing to the testnet with both nodes and our tools.

We have maintained 99.99% round uptime and <2ms benchmarks on mainnet.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

We continue to maintain all of our tools on WAX, of which several are open source. Our guild benchmark and reliability tools we believe are WAX staples.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Geographic Distribution?**

We continue to maintain nodes in countries with 3 or less guilds and across 2 jurisdictions.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Business Development?**

We are actively communicating (multiple meetings) with two companies about potentially bringing their products and services to WAX. We can't reveal these companies publicly but please contact @n8dee on Telegram if you need more info about who they are. We have reached out to a third company but no response yet.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

We continue to offer support to community members on Telegram.

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

Keep up the good work! One thing that isn't clear is whether this form submission is public or private. In the past it seems our first submission was posted publicly but the second one was not. If we know it's private and only visible by the OIG team then we can reveal more information about our biz dev work without follow-up Telegram conversations. We are fine with either approach but just need some guidance.

## Pre-Evaluation Form Responses

### Please provide some information regarding when and how your Guild got involved with the EOSIO or WAX ecosystem. Links to resources are helpful.

We started with EOSIO in early 2018 before the EOS mainnet launch and have been involved with that and a bunch of other EOSIO mainnets and testnets since then.

We followed WAX because of our interest in the project (we are gamers), and decided to support it after they announced on EOSIO.

### Has anyone in the Guild previously produced blocks on an EOSIO or DPOS network in the past? If so, which ones and what nodes did they help operate?

Yes, Aloha EOS has produced on BOS, MEETONE, Telos, ORE, and several testnets such as Jungle and Kylin.

### If your Guild has a warrant canary, please provide the link to it.

[https://canary.wax.gg/](https://canary.wax.gg/)

### If your Guild has a live video inspection of your infrastructure, please provide the link to it.

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/vtke994b9xs5rxg/IMG_1021.TRIM.MOV?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vtke994b9xs5rxg/IMG_1021.TRIM.MOV?dl=0)

### Please provide information regarding projects that your Guild is working on to improve the WAX ecosystem. Information about plans, progress, and timelines is helpful. This includes projects that have been submitted for the WAX Guild Showcase program.

A brief of our Showcase submission is in this post: https://wax.io/blog/announcing-the-accepted-wax-guild-showcase-projectsUpdate on DelphiOracle: 
We have completed code changes and are actively testing the oracle on the WAX mainnet on the "delphitester" account. We expect to be complete with testing and start onboarding Guilds as oracles within a couple weeks.

Beyond that, we continue to maintain all of our tools (Reliability Tracker, Benchmarks, etc.) on WAX, and we have community support people participating in the public WAX chat groups.

### Please state the jurisdiction your Guild is domiciled in, as well as the jurisdiction that your Guild's nodes are deployed in.

Domiciled in the United States and all nodes currently in the United States (Hawaii and Oregon). We have plans to expand our nodes to Asia and Europe.

### Please share any usage metrics you have, if any. This includes data specific to applications and user activity driven to the WAX ecosystem as a result of your Guild's efforts.

It's difficult to gauge, but we believe promoting WAX on our social channels, website, and tools has helped and will continue to help drive people to the WAX ecosystem.As far as user activity, we currently process around 70,000 API requests per day on our WAX public nodes.

### If possible, please share information about businesses that your Guild is engaging with that are seeking to learn about and leverage the WAX ecosystem in some way.

### Please share any information regarding community building efforts championed by your Guild. This can be facilitating translation of documentation, organizing meetups, and otherwise driving social and human engagement within the platform.

We promote WAX on our social channels which helps drive engagement. We also have two part-time team members offering community support in English and Chinese on Telegram.

### Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

Not at this time. The current guidelines and process have been great.

Notes:

- Should there be criteria around light and partial history?
- Five 9s too high? Consider 4 9s.
- WAX has precision of 8 instead of 4.
- "Responds to requests for missing Guild Roster information within 2 days." unncessary criteria
