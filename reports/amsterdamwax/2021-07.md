## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Similar to the previous months, the Light API has been running smoothly and we have continued hosting and maintaining it, as it is still being used by many different applications. The same goes for the WAX Payout Engine.

We have also continued working on the EOSIO 2.1 port for WAX, which is scheduled to be ready in the next couple of weeks.

Lastly, we have released a new product, namely the Light API public database for public access! The goal of the APi is to allow queries which are not implemented by the API, providing greater functionality and wider support. More information can be found here: https://github.com/cc32d9/eosio_light_api#public-database-access
