Similar to the previous months, the Light API has been running smoothly and we have continued hosting and maintaining it, as it is still being used by many different applications. The same goes for the WAX Payout Engine.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Similar to the previous months we are eager to share all the news with you!

### NEW - R2 staking mechanism
Following the success of our previous NFT sets together with R2, we have started working on the the next steps for these NFT sets, namely adding more utility to the NFTs. We are aiming to do this by building a fresh and innovative staking mechanism which will feature various interesting and engaging features. We will publish the roadmap for the staking mechanism soon, and will share more information in the next report.

### NEW - GEEPEEKAY x R2
In addition to the staking mechanism, we are also coming with a new set which is set to release late October. The set is a collaboration with GEEP/GEEPEEKAY.com, one of the most well-known GPK fan websites. The set features art by Rory McQueen, and is our most complex set so far by a big margin. The set comes with a unique crafting mechanism which consists of 3 different Levels of cards, 5 different subsets, a pack crafting mechanism and more! Similar to the staking mechanism, we will share more information about this soon/in the next report!

### Monsters of Rap 2
The Monsters of Rap 2 set has remained very popular and became even more fun after the release of the burning system, which allowed users to collect up to 30 unique Vinyls (https://monsters-of-rap.com/rewards/). Furthermore, we have begun dropping full collection rewards and will continue dropping them over the coming weeks.

### Other
We have concluded dropping LunaPark full collection rewards, and have continued supporting our other sets, with many physical items getting redeemed.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
