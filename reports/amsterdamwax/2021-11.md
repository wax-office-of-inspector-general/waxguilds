### R2 staking mechanism
Following the release of our roadmap, we have been working hard behind the scenes to start building the system. More information will follow soon. The roadmap can be found on the R2 website (https://r2-collectibles.com/roadmap/) and is shown in the Season 2 section.

### GEEPEEKAY x R2
The GEEPEEKAY x R2 set is a collaboration with GEEP/GEEPEEKAY.com, one of the most well-known GPK fan websites, and released November 13th. The set features art by Rory McQueen, and is our most complex set so far by a big margin, as it features all kinds of crafting mechanisms and new ideas! The set attracted a very wide audience, with over 20000 WAX accounts holding at least 1 card of the collection. This set will also be included in the R2 staking mechanism, providing even more utility outside of the crafting and other features of the set. More information on the set can be found on the website: https://geepeekay.io/.

### Other
On November 12th we've conducted an experiment of running a producer in memory-constrained environment: a producer server with 32GB RAM and state in tmpfs was successfully producing on WAX mainnet or several hours without any performance degradation. In addition to this, bdata.one started providing the daily WAX activity statistics, with financial accounting data coming in a few days.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
Our content has continued helping people and the big influx of new users into the ecosystem is evident in our numbers as well, with views on our content doubling as compared to the previous 30 days (https://ibb.co/qDYPzQG). We will continue to keep our content up-to-date and useful, in order to give our readers a comprehensive understanding of everything in the WAX ecosystem. Lastly, cc32d9 and Yannick have also been helping people in various channels.
