EOS Amsterdam

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We have continued offering and maintaining our Atomic Assets API for free! Additionally, we've just upgraded our public AtomicAssets API infrastructure, and also enabled market queries. It can be found here: https://validate.eosnation.io/wax/reports/endpoints.html.

In addition to this, we are now providing history on the testnet.

Lastly, we are still supporting Hyperion servers which are being used internally by the WAX team.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Similar to the previous months, the Light API has been running smoothly and we have continued hosting and maintaining it, as it is still being used by many different applications. We are also working on additional documentation for the database so more people can access it.

Lastly, bdata.one (https://bdata.one/), our public service providing access to various blockchain data archives has been fully operational and has been running smoothly since the introduction of the various data archives.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Just like the previous months we are excited to share all the news with you!

### R2 staking mechanism
Over the past period a lot of development work has been done on the R2 Staking Mechanism, and we are happy to announce that the first version of the R2 staking system has now been released! - https://r2-rewards.com/. At the moment of writing, almost 50.000 NFTs are staked already with an estimated value in excess of $200.000. Feedback has been really useful so far and we have continued development of the system, with updates arriving soon!

### Educational content
Our content has continued helping people over the past period with views on our content only slightly declining as compared to the previous period (https://ibb.co/VgDGXyq). Our guide to using your WAX account has also surpassed 20.000 views. We have and will continue to keep our content up-to-date and useful, in order to give our readers a comprehensive understanding of everything in the WAX ecosystem. Lastly, cc32d9 and Yannick have also been helping people in various channels.

### EOSIO/Mandel
Following the community initiative to create a community release of EOSIO, named Mandel (https://www.eosgo.io/news/eos-migration-to-mandel-takes-first-step), we have started to experiment with the new release candidate on WAX, in order to create a Mandel release candidate for WAX. Last month we finished a release candidate and we have continued testing this release candidate in order to ensure it's compatibility and robustness.

### Commercial History Solutions
While never explicitly mentioned, we have always had a few API servers available for commercial access and are still offering these. This service is still running and being offered to various partners.

### Other
Lastly, we have continued participating in a working group that is focusing on WAX scalability in order to ensure WAX can continue scaling at this rate. Furthermore, we have been doing small things for various previous collaborations with R2 in order to ensure these collections aren't being forgotten.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
