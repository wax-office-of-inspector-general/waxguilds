### R2 staking mechanism
The R2 staking mechanism has been one of our main products over the past month, with hundreds of users staking their R2 NFTs for rewards. We have been working hard on the second phase of the staking mechanism, which will feature the introduction of the R2 shop and the official token release. The aim is to release this in the coming months. Additionally, we have been adding our new Graffiti Kings set to the staking system as well.

### *NEW* Graffiti Kings x R2 Burn Event
In collaboration with R2 and Graffiti Kings we have released a major burn event! 
1 year ago we released the incredibly successful Graffiti Kings x R2 Series 1 NFTs, and the set is one of the biggest sets on WAX in terms of total NFTs. Therefore we have created a burn event where users can burn their Series 1 NFTs for special rewards and stakeable NFTs. Additionally, users have a chance to receive unqiue NFTs from our MONGOS collection. So far thousands of Series 1 NFTs have been burned in the event, with many more to follow. More information can be found on the website - https://r2-graffitikings.io/

### Educational content
Our content has continued helping people over the past period with views on our content only slightly declining as compared to the previous period (https://ibb.co/M8nh8ng). We have and will continue to keep our content up-to-date and useful, in order to give our readers a comprehensive understanding of everything in the WAX ecosystem. Lastly, cc32d9 and Yannick have also been helping people in various channels.

### EOSIO/Mandel
As mentioned in the previous report, we have been working hard to make a release candidate of Mandel for WAX, and we are proud to announce it is now available! This allows WAX to utilise the latest and greatest version of the EOSIO software. It can be found here - https://github.com/cc32d9/wax-mandel

### Commercial History Solutions
The API service is still running and being offered to various partners.

### Other
Lastly, we have continued participating in a working group that is focusing on WAX scalability in order to ensure WAX can continue scaling at this rate.
