## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Just like the previous months we are excited to share all the news with you!

### *NEW* Exposition Park Holdings (wax.io)
While mentioned for the first time in this report, we have been helping Exposition Park Holdings, the team behind wax.io, with setting up and maintaining their infrastructure for the past couple of months. Given that the new influx of users has been troublesome at times for the WAX Cloud Wallet, we are now working with them to completely rebuild the WCW infrastructure so it is better equipped to deal with all of these users down the line. Furthermore, we are also improving the hosting of the WCW. 

### *NEW* bInfra.one
Although block producers are maintaing the public infrastructure, it is often overloaded with bot traffic, and protected by rate limits. Also each BP is usually serving a specific geographical area, while the applications have their users everywhere around the globe. Therefore we offer Infrastructure as a Service for various blockchain applications, and have helped various popular applications with their infrastructure so far. Some of the notable clients include milliononmars.com, desertfarm.io, and arenaofglory.io.

### R2 staking mechanism
The R2 staking mechanism has continued to be one of our main products over the past month, with hundreds of users staking over 50.000 R2 NFTs for rewards. We have continued working hard on the second phase of the staking mechanism, which will feature the introduction of the R2 shop and the official token release. Additionally, we have been doing small promos and tests with the staking system to keep users engaged. 

### Educational content
Our content has continued helping people over the past period with views on our content slightly declining as compared to the previous period. We have and will continue to keep our content up-to-date and useful, in order to give our readers a comprehensive understanding of everything in the WAX ecosystem. We have also released new documentation on how you can deploy a WAX node in various environments - https://github.com/cc32d9/wax-node-instructions. Lastly, cc32d9 and Yannick have also been helping people in various channels.

### EOSIO/Mandel
As mentioned in the previous report, we released a candidate of Mandel for WAX! This allows WAX to utilise the latest and greatest version of the EOSIO software. It can be found here - https://github.com/cc32d9/wax-mandel

### Commercial History Solutions
The API service is still running and being offered to various partners. A notable point is that we are now supporting the API of the Wombat Wallet as well.

### Other
Some other points worth mentioning:
* We have continued participating in a working group that is focusing on WAX scalability in order to ensure WAX can continue scaling at this rate.
* We are participating in a collaboration group between WAX, Telos, EOS, and other EOSIO chains.
* We have helped Green Rabbit with troubleshooting their infrastructure.
