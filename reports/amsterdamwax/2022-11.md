## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
Just like the previous months we are excited to share all the news with you!

### *NEW* Antelope Smart Contract Developer's Handbook
Over the past months our CTO, cc32d9, has been working on a smart contract developer's handbook which aims to address all the questions existing and prospective Antelope smart contract developers might have. This should make developer onboarding even easier. The handbook can be found here: https://cc32d9.gitbook.io/antelope-smart-contract-developers-handbook/

### Memento
Last month we released Memento as a public service. In essence, Memento is a MariaDB or Postgresql/TimescaleDB database containing transaction traces from an EOSIO blockchain (such as EOS, Telos or WAX), and providing convenient indexes for quick searching.

A typical use case for Memento is tracking incoming and outgoing payments for a specific account, and checking their reversibility.

The database may contain traces for all contracts on the blockchain, or it may be limited to a specific subset of accounts. Dapps can set up their own instances, while public infrastructure providers may offer the service to a wider audience.

### Exposition Park Holdings (wax.io)
We have continued helping Exposition Park Holdings, the team behind wax.io, with maintaining their infrastructure.

### bInfra.one
Although block producers are maintaing the public infrastructure, it is often overloaded with bot traffic, and protected by rate limits. Also each BP is usually serving a specific geographical area, while the applications have their users everywhere around the globe. Therefore we offer Infrastructure as a Service for various blockchain applications, and have helped various popular applications with their infrastructure so far. Some of the notable clients include milliononmars.com, desertfarm.io, and arenaofglory.io.

### Educational content
Our content has continued helping people over the past period with views on our content slightly declining as compared to the previous period. We have and will continue to keep our content up-to-date and useful, in order to give our readers a comprehensive understanding of everything in the WAX ecosystem. Lastly, cc32d9 and Yannick have also been helping people in various channels.

### Antelope/Mandel/WAX-leap
This month we have continued implementing the latest updates for WAX Leap following the updates to Antelope. More information can be found here: https://github.com/cc32d9/wax-leap

### Commercial History Solutions
The API service is still running and being offered to various partners. A notable point is that we are still supporting the API of the Wombat Wallet as well.

### Usage statistics
In addition to our regular updates we also want to provide usage statistics for our APIs, history solutions and p2p connections. They are still as follows:
WAX RPC: 1.3M API requests per hour on average
EOSIO Light API: 520k requests per hour on average, with 98% of the requests coming from WAX
Atomic Assets API: 45k requests per hour on average
History: 23k history requests per hour on average
P2P connections: ~250 connections in total

### Other
Some other points worth mentioning:
* We have continued participating in a working group that is focusing on WAX scalability in order to ensure WAX can continue scaling at this rate.
* We have continued participating in a collaboration group between WAX, Telos, EOS, and other EOSIO chains. Additionally, we are supporting ENF in their contributions towards Antelope through Zaisan.
