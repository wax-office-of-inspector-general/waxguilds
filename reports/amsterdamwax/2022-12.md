## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We have continued offering and maintaining our Atomic Assets API as well as providing history on the testnet for free!

Since this month we have also created and released a Hyperion health checker for haproxy. It monitors the last indexed block and number of unindexed blocks, and stops sending requests to it if they exceed the thresholds. More information can be found here. - https://github.com/cc32d9/eosio-haproxy

Lastly, we are still supporting Hyperion servers which are being used internally by the WAX team. Additionally, we have continued supporting Hyperion for testnet.

Up-to-date usage statistics are provided below!

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?
Similar to the previous months, the Light API has been running smoothly and we have continued hosting and maintaining it, as it is still being used by many different applications.

Lastly, bdata.one (https://bdata.one/), our public service providing access to various blockchain data archives has been fully operational and has been running smoothly since the introduction of the various data archives.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

### *NEW* NFT-releases.com
Since this month, EOS Amsterdam has partnered up with the founders of NFT-releases.com to create a central hub for NFT collectors to stay up-to-date on the latest NFT news and collections, and to make collecting and playing NFT-oriented games more fun and engaging. EOS Amsterdam will be assisting them with their strategy, marketing, and technology. While the project is still at a very early stage, we hope that we can make this a success together. A first version of the website can be found at https://nft-releases.com/.

### *NEW* Antelope Smart Contract Developer's Handbook
As mentioned in the previous report, our CTO, cc32d9, created a smart contract developer's handbook which aims to address all the questions existing and prospective Antelope smart contract developers might have. This should make developer onboarding even easier. The handbook has received small updates and small mistakes have now been ironed out. The handbook can be found here: https://cc32d9.gitbook.io/antelope-smart-contract-developers-handbook/

### Memento
Memento is a MariaDB or Postgresql/TimescaleDB database containing transaction traces from an EOSIO blockchain (such as EOS, Telos or WAX), and providing convenient indexes for quick searching.

A typical use case for Memento is tracking incoming and outgoing payments for a specific account, and checking their reversibility.

The database may contain traces for all contracts on the blockchain, or it may be limited to a specific subset of accounts. dApps can set up their own instances, while public infrastructure providers may offer the service to a wider audience.

### Exposition Park Holdings (wax.io)
We have continued helping Exposition Park Holdings, the team behind wax.io, with maintaining their infrastructure.

### bInfra.one
Although block producers are maintaining the public infrastructure, it is often overloaded with bot traffic, and protected by rate limits. Also each BP is usually serving a specific geographical area, while the applications have their users everywhere around the globe. Therefore we offer Infrastructure as a Service for various blockchain applications, and have helped various popular applications with their infrastructure so far. Some of the notable clients include milliononmars.com, desertfarm.io, and arenaofglory.io.

### Educational content
Our content has continued helping people over the past period with views on our content slightly declining as compared to the previous period. We have and will continue to keep our content up-to-date and useful, in order to give our readers a comprehensive understanding of everything in the WAX ecosystem. Lastly, cc32d9 and Yannick have also been helping people in various channels.

### Antelope/Mandel/WAX-leap
Last month we continued implementing the latest updates for WAX Leap following the updates to Antelope. We now remain on standby for further upgrades. More information can be found here: https://github.com/cc32d9/wax-leap

### Commercial History Solutions
The API service is still running and being offered to various partners. A notable point is that we are still supporting the API of the Wombat Wallet as well.

### *UPDATED* Usage statistics
In addition to our regular updates we also want to provide usage statistics for our APIs, history solutions and p2p connections. They are still as follows:
WAX RPC: 760k API requests per hour on average
EOSIO Light API: 336k requests per hour on average, with 98% of the requests coming from WAX
Atomic Assets API: 45k requests per hour on average
History: 20k history requests per hour on average
P2P connections: ~200 connections in total

### Other
Some other points worth mentioning:
* We have continued participating in a working group that is focusing on WAX scalability in order to ensure WAX can continue scaling at this rate.
* We have continued participating in a collaboration group between WAX, Telos, EOS, and other EOSIO chains.
* Continued support of ENF in their contributions towards Antelope (through business development and marketing) via Zaisan.
