## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
Just like the previous months we are excited to share all the news with you!

### *NEW* Wombat APIs
Through Zaisan we are now offering WAX and EOS APIs to the Wombat wallet.

### HTTP API Memento
Memento is our lightweight history service for Antelope blockchains which has been greatly received by the community. To continue supporting Memento released a HTTP API on top of the Memento database last month, supporting both MySQL and Postgres backends. Additionally, it also has a GraphQL interface in addition to the RESTful interface. More information can be found here: https://github.com/Antelope-Memento/antelope_memento_api and https://github.com/Antelope-Memento/antelope_memento/blob/main/MEMENTO_PUBLIC_ACCESS.md

### NFT-releases.com
Since partnering up with NFT-releases.com to create a central hub for NFT collectors to stay up-to-date on the latest NFT news and collections, we have continued assisting them with their strategy, marketing, and technology. Last month has been relatively quiet in terms of developments due to holidays but this will pick up again this month. A first version of the website can be found at https://nft-releases.com/.

### Antelope/Mandel/WAX-leap
Following the latest updates last month we have been monitoring everything to ensure everything is working as intended.

### Antelope Smart Contract Developer's Handbook
The smart contract developer's handbook aims to address all the questions existing and prospective Antelope smart contract developers might have. This should make developer onboarding even easier. The handbook has received small updates and small mistakes have now been ironed out. The handbook can be found here: https://cc32d9.gitbook.io/antelope-smart-contract-developers-handbook/

### Memento
Memento is a MariaDB or Postgresql/TimescaleDB database containing transaction traces from an EOSIO blockchain (such as EOS, Telos or WAX), and providing convenient indexes for quick searching.

A typical use case for Memento is tracking incoming and outgoing payments for a specific account, and checking their reversibility.

The database may contain traces for all contracts on the blockchain, or it may be limited to a specific subset of accounts. dApps can set up their own instances, while public infrastructure providers may offer the service to a wider audience.

### Exposition Park Holdings (wax.io)
We have continued helping Exposition Park Holdings, the team behind wax.io, with maintaining their infrastructure.

### bInfra.one
Although block producers are maintaining the public infrastructure, it is often overloaded with bot traffic, and protected by rate limits. Also each BP is usually serving a specific geographical area, while the applications have their users everywhere around the globe. Therefore we offer Infrastructure as a Service for various blockchain applications, and have helped various popular applications with their infrastructure so far. Some of the notable clients include milliononmars.com, desertfarm.io, and arenaofglory.io.

### Educational content
Our content has continued helping people over the past period with views on our content slightly declining as compared to the previous period. We have and will continue to keep our content up-to-date and useful, in order to give our readers a comprehensive understanding of everything in the WAX ecosystem. Lastly, cc32d9 and Yannick have also been helping people in various channels.

### Commercial History Solutions
The API service is still running and being offered to various partners. A notable point is that we are still supporting the API of the Wombat Wallet as well.

### *UPDATED* Usage statistics
In addition to our regular updates we also want to provide usage statistics for our APIs, history solutions and p2p connections. They are still as follows:
WAX RPC: 740k API requests per hour on average
EOSIO Light API: 370k requests per hour on average, with 97% of the requests coming from WAX
Atomic Assets API: 46k requests per hour on average
History: 21k history requests per hour on average
P2P connections: ~200 connections in total

### Other
Some other points worth mentioning:
* We have continued participating in a collaboration group between WAX, Telos, EOS, and other Antelope chains.
* Continued support of ENF in their contributions towards Antelope (through business development and marketing) via Zaisan and participated in Paris Blockchain Week with them recently.
