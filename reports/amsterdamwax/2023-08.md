## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
Just like the previous months we are excited to share all the news with you!

### Chronicle
Following the recent release of the new feature, we have closely monitored it's implementation. To recap, the new feature allows user to create portable snapshots which allow an easy upgrade from version 2.x to 3.x. The new feature is available in versions 2.7 and 3.2. More information can be found here - https://github.com/EOSChronicleProject/eos-chronicle/releases

### Chronos
Chronos is a history solution for Antelope blockchains. Chronos indexes the transaction traces of an Antelope blockchain in a ScyllaDB database.

[ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/) is an open-source re-implementation of Apache Cassandra database. It's faster because it's implemented in C++, and it supports data sharding.

The database architecture allows for an enormous data ingestion performance. A single server can handle about 100k inserts per second with secondary indexes and materialized views, or even 500k inserts per second without secondary indexes.

The data model of ScyllaDB is that each table or materialized view is a hash of sorted trees: the partition key is an unsortable hash key, and each partition is a sorted tree. Also each tree cannot contain more than 2 billion rows. This implies the limitations and restrictions on the application data model.

### Memento
Memento is a MariaDB or Postgresql/TimescaleDB database containing transaction traces from an EOSIO blockchain (such as EOS, Telos or WAX), and providing convenient indexes for quick searching. 

Folowing the release of a new feature last month we have ensured it's correct implementation.

A typical use case for Memento is tracking incoming and outgoing payments for a specific account, and checking their reversibility. The database may contain traces for all contracts on the blockchain, or it may be limited to a specific subset of accounts. dApps can set up their own instances, while public infrastructure providers may offer the service to a wider audience.

It can also be accessed through a HTTP API, supporting both MySQL and Postgres backends. Additionally, it also has a GraphQL interface in addition to the RESTful interface.

### Wombat APIs
Through Zaisan we are still offering WAX and EOS APIs to the Wombat wallet.

### Antelope/WAX-leap
We are continuously standing by for new releases.

### Antelope Smart Contract Developer's Handbook
The smart contract developer's handbook aims to address all the questions existing and prospective Antelope smart contract developers might have. This should make developer onboarding even easier. The handbook has received small updates and small mistakes have now been ironed out. The handbook can be found here: https://cc32d9.gitbook.io/antelope-smart-contract-developers-handbook/

### Exposition Park Holdings (wax.io)
We have continued helping Exposition Park Holdings, the team behind wax.io, with maintaining their infrastructure.

### bInfra.one
bInfra.one is an infrastucture service for dApps to offer them stronger and more reliable infrastructure. This service has helped various popular applications with their infrastructure so far. Some of the notable clients include milliononmars.com, desertfarm.io, and arenaofglory.io.

### Educational content
Our content has continued helping people over the past period with views on our content slightly declining as compared to the previous period. We have and will continue to keep our content up-to-date and useful, in order to give our readers a comprehensive understanding of everything in the WAX ecosystem. Lastly, cc32d9 and Yannick have also been helping people in various channels.

### Commercial History Solutions
The API service is still running and being offered to various partners. A notable point is that we are still supporting the API of the Wombat Wallet as well.

### *UPDATED* Usage statistics
In addition to our regular updates we also want to provide usage statistics for our APIs, history solutions and p2p connections. They are still as follows:
WAX RPC: 313k API requests per hour on average
EOSIO Light API: 107k requests per hour on average, with 96% of the requests coming from WAX
Atomic Assets API: 27k requests per hour on average
WAX Hyperion: 36k history requests per hour on average


### Other
Some other points worth mentioning:
* We have continued participating in a collaboration group between WAX, Telos, EOS, and other Antelope chains.
