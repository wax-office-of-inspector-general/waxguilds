Similar to the previous months, the Light API has been running smoothly and we have continued hosting and maintaining it, as it is still being used by many different applications. The WAX Payout Engine has been running smoothly as well. Due to a declining number of users we have decided to decommission the State Track API (more information here: [https://eos-amsterdam.medium.com/decommissioning-the-state-track-api-9d05b1e2e299](https://eos-amsterdam.medium.com/decommissioning-the-state-track-api-9d05b1e2e299)). We are currently working on setting up a public database of LightAPI data so it’s accessible in a more convenient and efficient manner, and will share more about this product soon.Lastly, we have started working on a EOSIO 2.1 port for WAX. It is mostly done, with only test cases needing to get finalized.

The set sold out in less than 24 hours and at the moment of writing (20-6-2021), over 22000 unique WAX accounts are holding at least 1 Graffiti Kings NFT. This makes Graffiti Kings our biggest set so far, and we can be certain the set has caused a sizable influx of new users into the WAX ecosystem. The Telegram group currently holds around 2500 members, many of whom are actively participating in everything. 1 week ago we opened our latest burn feature called the Paint Shop, and over 15% of the total supply of cards has been burned already!

These problems are now resolved, and Bittrex’s WAX nodes are operational again largely thanks to this support.

## January 2021

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

No new developments, everything has been going steady.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

Both the Light API and the State Track API have been running smoothly and we have continued hosting and maintaining these two APIs, as they are still being used by many different applications.

We have also been working on the WAX Labs contract and the progress has been great. Over the past weeks we have been working on various new features, such as organizing indexes for fast GUI access, status update messages, informing about latest changes in the review process, and optimizing RAM usage, so that most of the RAM is paid by proposer. The smart contract should be ready for release within a couple of weeks!

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?**

We have a lot of ecosystem development news! We'll start with Monsters of Rap: The sale started on 19-12 and the set has attracted over 300 unique buyers, and over 20% of these buyers are new accounts (<1 month old) that have never collected on the WAX blockchain before! Our MoR Telegram group (

[https://t.me/Monsters_of_Rap](https://t.me/Monsters_of_Rap)

) has also grown to over 700 members and we have many active users. In the coming weeks we will be working on various interesting promos to reach an even wider audience.

R2 Collectibles: Following the success of Mutant Warriors and Monsters of Rap, we have been working on onboarding new companies onto WAX, and we have a couple of exciting partnerships coming up! We look forward to sharing more information about this soon!

EOSIO 2.x: As mentioned in our previous submission, we are currently working on an EOSIO 2.1 RC for WAX. Over the past couple of weeks we have been reviewing the code and have been working with B1 to improve the code and fix various bugs. We will continue working on this until we have a sufficient EOSIO 2.1 RC.

- NEW* WAX Payout Engine: Over the past couple of months we have also been working on a WAX Payout Engine, and we were happy to announce it during the past month. Anyone who has built automated payments on an EOSIO blockchain knows the problem well: the payments may fail for a number of reasons, such as insufficient CPU or RAM on sender account, or the transaction gets dropped by a microfork. The Payout Engine solves this problem. Whenever there's a failure, it guarantees to retry and never double-spend. The engine is available for any project that needs to automate payments, such as e-commerce, dividends, salary, etc, and it will help new companies to get started on WAX and it will enable them to build better applications. Comprehensive documentation of the Payout Engine can be found here:

[https://github.com/cc32d9/eosio_payout](https://github.com/cc32d9/eosio_payout)

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

While we have not created any new content, our existing content has always been kept up-to-date and is still helping hundreds of people every month (proof:

[https://ibb.co/0Xd9j74](https://ibb.co/0Xd9j74)

). Furthermore, cc32d9 and Yannick have also been helping people in various channels.

Lastly, we have maintained and continued to provide FileHashFact.

- We have been doing various promotions together with R2, but since these promotions concerned Mutant Warriors and Monsters of Rap, we have decided not to list these, as the OIG has decided these are not eligible to receive any points.

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

In addition to our feedback from last month (we are not sure whether it is valuable to include offering V1 history as a criteria, as we believe V1 obsolote and hungry on resources), we also want to mention that we don't fully agree with making WAX product/NFT set related marketing efforts ineligible to receive any points.

For example, we have been putting a lot of effort into promoting our various NFT collection releases (together with R2), and we have always tried to reach new audiences in order to reach an audience that is not familiar WAX. While the main purpose of these marketing efforts is not to onboard more users onto WAX, they definitely help a lot in this regard, and many of the (new) WAX users that are onboarded through our marketing efforts, stick around to discover more than just the specific NFT set they initially got interested in. We feel that these marketing efforts are not fairly represented with the current criteria, and we would love for the criteria to be adapted so the contribution that these marketing efforts that aren't directly focused on WAX, yet contribute a fair amount to the WAX ecosystem, are represented in the criteria.

- **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Business Development criteria? Please provide details.**Mutant Warriors: The Mutant Warriors set has been going steady! And while interest in the set has, logically, been slowing down over time. There are still tens of people participating daily in the conversations in the MW TG channel. We are also still doing promotions for our active members, in order to keep the set interesting.Monsters of Rap:As said in our last OIG submission, Monsters of Rap is our latest set together with R2 and it features many different rappers, and amazing artwork by former GPK artist Rory McQueen.

- **Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**We were surprised to see the full history criteria being split up, and are not certain whether valuing V1 history similarly to V2/dfuse history is a good move. In our opinion, V1 history is obsolote and hungry on resources.Other than that, though, we are very happy with the continuous improvements to the guidelines and want to thank the IGs for their ongoing efforts.

## November 2020

We have created and deployed a smart contract for signing and co-signing file hashes is deployed on WAX Testnet.

The goal of this smart contract is to let blockchain users declare a file hash under their names. For example, a blockchain block producer is producing a blockchain snapshot, and declares it as valid. or a software company publishes a package and signs it off with its own blockchain account.

The contract allows other blockchain users co-sign, or endorse the file hashes. By doing so, the users confirm the file validity. The contract accepts up to 16 endorsements for each file.

Each signer or co-signer pays for the RAM allocation required to store the data. An endorsement takes about 300-350 bytes of the co-signor RAM, depending on the length of the memo string.

More information can be found here: https://github.com/Europechain/filehashfact

We don't want to submit this as a new product, but just wanted to mention this.

In addition to that we have also made various updates to some older articles to make them more relevant and useful.

- **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations criteria? Please provide details.**(Not directly suitable for any categories, just an update)-Internal WAX P2P initiative.As the WAX network is growing, the public P2P endpoints start getting saturated. This affects the stability of inter-guild communication, as the producing nodes need to exchange the data as fast as possible.EOS Amsterdam has come up with an initiative, to build a ring of internal p2p endpoints: they are not listed on public resources, and are only intended for guilds to connect from their infrastructure nodes. Each guild is free to join the initiative and add their dedicated nodes to the list, and each guild is free to choose to connect or not connect to these endpoints. There is no filtering or VPN, and the nodes are open for any guild to connect.Once this initiative is supported by a higher number of guilds, it will allow freeing up the public p2p endpoints for dapps and third party services.The list of internal peers is maintained on keybase at: keybase://team/wax_guilds/prod/wax_internal_p2p.txtAs of today (08-07-2020), BlockCrafters has joined the initiative.

## **June 2020**

- **What is the name of your Guild?**EOS Amsterdam
- **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations criteria? Please provide details.**While not directly relevant to any of the criteria, EOS Amsterdam has come up with a technical initiative, to organize a separate tier of p2p services for inter-guild communucation, so that only registered guilds connect their servers to it. This will free up their public p2p endpoints for dApp services which need a sustainable network connection. It is important to note that the new tier does not involve any firewalling or VPN, and each guild is completely free to decide how they want to interconnect with blockchain nodes.We rolled out two first hosts in this internal tier of p2p services, in Amsterdam and Singapore. The list is available in the team folder at Keybase, and all guilds are welcome to connect to these endpoints and to add their own internal endpoints to the list.

We have always hosted and maintained the EOSIO Light API ([https://github.com/cc32d9/eosio_light_api](https://github.com/cc32d9/eosio_light_api)) and the EOSIO State Track API ([https://github.com/GetScatter/EOSIO-State-Track](https://github.com/GetScatter/EOSIO-State-Track)), which are used by many top block explorers and applications. While it is not new information, we’d like to mention this with regards to the changes made in the new v1.5 guidelines.

We personally feel like the creation of educational resources is worth more than one point. With the current guidelines, creating a couple of educational articles is worth just as much as mentioning WAX at a blockchain/EOSIO meetup, which just does not feel right to us. We suggest being able to earn up to 2 points for educational content, with 1 point being awarded to anyone who has made even a small contribution to creating educational content, and 2 points to anyone who goes beyond just a small contribution to the creation of educational content.

Other than that we are very satisfied with the changes and greatly appreciate all the work you have put in the reports so far!

# Pre-Evaluation Form Responses

### Please provide some information regarding when and how your Guild got involved with the EOSIO or WAX ecosystem. Links to resources are helpful.

EOS Amsterdam was founded by a team of 3 blockchain enthusiasts looking to make a difference on the EOS blockchain, and has grown to become a team of 11 experienced and talented EOSIO enthusiasts who are working daily to add value to the EOSIO ecosystem. After being active on various different EOSIO chains, such as EOS, BOS, and Europechain, we announced our WAX Guild candidacy a couple of months ago, as we have always been big fans of the developments made by the WAX team and wanted to contribute to the WAX ecosystem. Since the announcement of our Guild candidacy, we have put a lot of effort towards adding value to the WAX ecosystem. More information about our team can be found on our website: [https://eosamsterdam.net/](https://eosamsterdam.net/)

### Has anyone in the Guild previously produced blocks on an EOSIO or DPOS network in the past? If so, which ones and what nodes did they help operate?

Most of the members of our team have been involved in the operation of blockchains over the past year(s), and our CTO, cc32d9, has extensive experience operating nodes on EOS, BOS, Instar, and Europechain (and now also WAX). We are currently producing blocks on WAX (and Europechain) in a stable and reliable manner.

In addition to that, we have been translating our educational content to Chinese to help with the Asian WAX community building. We have also remained active in Asian WAX channels and have helped users there, wherever possible. Our educational content can be found here: [https://bihu.com/people/1046186](https://bihu.com/people/1046186) (Chinese) and [https://medium.com/@eos_amsterdam/](https://medium.com/@eos_amsterdam/) (English).
