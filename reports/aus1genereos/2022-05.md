# Product Development

## [Uplift World](https://theuplift.world/)

We have been working with the uplift team since inception and share resources among our teams; we have an exclusive partnership in place to be the official Uplift BP candidate. The Uplift World is a community-first metaverse built on the WAX blockchain and running on Minecraft as a base layer.

Built from the ground up with gratitude in mind, it is our mission to allow for a safe and sustainable environment where all can thrive. We have been open to landholders and those they add as members to their plots since April 2021, which for a blockchain metaverse is a good indication we are well beyond our infancy!


These are the usage statistics since inception

| Users    | NFTs Minted| 
| --------- | ---------- | 
| 8692    | 306,000   | 

Next, we are working on implementing a [DAO voting structure](https://upliftworld.gitbook.io/upliftworld-whitepaper/state-of-the-uplift/a-non-linear-dao-roadmap), that will vote on a list of community derived features [proposed features](https://upliftworld.gitbook.io/upliftworld-whitepaper/state-of-the-uplift/a-non-linear-dao-roadmap/first-features-to-vote-on)

## EOSIO Smart Contract Testing Framework

As pitched in [Pomelo](https://pomelo.io/grants/sclibraries) and then via the [ENF Grant Framework](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/pull/10), we have been approved to build out an EOSIO based smart contract testing framework. The smart contract testing library will be built with Javascript leveraging eosio-core built by Greymass giving you the ability to dockerize a light EOSIO node that can run on any system. This allows the ability for the user to host it on their system easily and automated with the ability to test for multiple EOSIO based chains i.e EOS, WAX, TELOS, PROTON, FIO and UX. It also allows for each project to simply set up CI/CD and seed table data without modifying the contracts. All code will be open sourced under MIT so it is free for the community to use, creating no barrier to entry for developers.

Features

- Open-source MIT license
- Ability to init/reset table data
- Ability to test accounts and permissions
- Built with Javascript
- Dockerize a light EOSIO node that can be run on the users system automatically
- Ability to test multiple EOSIO(EOS/WAX/TELOS) networks with links to public snapshots.
- Simplified method to setup CI/CD

Timeline;

- V1 will be released at the end of August 22

Roadmap;

- We are investigating how to add our contributions to the Vert project
- We are investigating using Clang to create a Code coverage library
- We are investigating using Clang to create a linter library


# Ecosystem Development

## Stealth Deal (info emailed to the OIG)

## [Stoney Baloney Cards](http://stoneybaloneycards.com)

We helped Stoney Baloney move away from neftyblocks to another marketplace that offered credit card purchases. This required some custom dev work from neftyblocks which we offset with personal nefty tokens.
Ultimately, they weren't getting the results they expected from the new marketplace and decided to move back to neftyblocks. During the move we brainstormed and reconfigured a 13 card pack priced at $36 into 3 pack options and 3 price points with extra nfts for marketing. This required extra dev work and nefty services which were negated because of the 45000 nefty tokens we transferred to them for level 3 vip staking rewards. This final process took approximately 4 weeks to complete. 
We continue to advise them on several different issues. Taking custody of a custom account for managing their collection and the funds received from proceeds of the sale. 
 
We arranged a collaboration / mining event with alienworlds.io and we're also in talks to do some custom artwork for the alienworlds / stoney metaverse 
 
We have also done some twitter giveaways and we help moderate their telegram chat: https://t.me/stoneybaloneycards

# WAX Strategic Contributions

With over 8000 users and 300,000 NFTs minted, we feel that Uplift.World brings outstanding value to the WAX ecosystem in the form of Games, Marketing, Promotion and NFT solutions. Bridging WAX NFTs to the metaverse/game world of minecraft with over 141 million players worldwide enables WAX to tap into the mainstream market, giving a proof of concept to other entrepreneurs and builders that they too can blend the two worlds together.
