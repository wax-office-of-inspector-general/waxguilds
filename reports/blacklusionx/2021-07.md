This month issues were resolved with the Atomic API. Currently the History and Hyperion is unfortunately down, but we are actively working on it to sync it and bring it back up asap.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### Validationcore
I know the past months this has been in the "under development" status. This month I cannot show a final version of the product quite yet. However I would like to provide further information what we are currently working on and why the development takes longer than expected. The old version was made for single chain usage and only had telegram bot notifications. Everything was implemented only with the idea of sending telegram messages. We would like to take this project to the point that we offer a full website and additionally telegram notifications. Since all validations are stored in a database we would like to expand the validator to show some uptime stats of API Nodes etc. To pave the way for these features some major changes to the database scheme had to be made, having a big impact on the current implementation and slowing down development. The goal is to decouple everything as much as possible and to make the configuration as flexible as possible so the valildationcore and its api can be used by other projects as well.

What we have been working on this month:
- A complete new way of storing the configuration settings for each chain was implemented (it will now be easier to add new chains). This will allow to make the tests flexible and to turn of single checks for every chain whenever needed.
- The telegram messages will now be only links to the website instead of multiple messages, reducing spam. This also means that this had to be decoupled from the code and completely reworked.
- A Graph-QL API was implemented, that allows to extract data from the database and create human readable message for any validation. The website frontend will communicate with the API to show the validations.
- The website was further improved and new features were added.

There was a lot of progress this month, but since all parts are dependent on each other, there is no working version I can show. However, I am optimistic to show the first working version of the website in August.

### OneApi
As its highly dependent on the validationcore the service is currently down and a more stable version will be launched together with the new version of validationcore.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

No

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

No

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

I like that you are moving away from Notion. I am not sure if forking a repository is the best way to solve this, however I think this makes this process already a lot more transparent and we can have the certainty that you received the submission.
