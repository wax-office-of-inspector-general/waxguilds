### Validationcore
As promised in the last report we will show the first working version of the validationcore this month. August was filled with a lot of small bug fixes and improvements to make the different services (validationcore, api and website) work with each other. The current version of the validationcore is not fully stable/production ready yet, however I really wanted to show a "working" website this month and not just screenshots, therefore we deployed the current version still with a couple of flaws. In the next days we will further improve the validationcore to a point where it will run stable and deliver consistent results. The validationcore was designed with uptime stats in mind. The validationcore validates the infrastructure every 10mins. This allows us to calculate representative percentages of the uptime. The implementation is planned for next month.
