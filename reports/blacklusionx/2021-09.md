### Validationcore
The validationcore is production ready and results are representative.

As promised last month we also implemented the uptime stats this month. An uptime score is calculated by dividing the amount of working validations by the total amount of validations. This is currently done for each day, resulting in a graph on a daily basis.

For us, this means that the validationcore is "released", since the validationcore is not only the website but also the open source software behind it, which can be used by other products as well. We will keep improving the actual validator and add additional checks in the future, however the validationcore is fully functional at the moment as it is. The current status of the website is a bit different. Openly speaking its only really useable on a desktop device and we would love to implement additional features and increase useability. As you can see we opted for a custom React frontend with a focus on design and good UX. Our goal is to create an easy to use explorer for all of WAX infrastructure. And to create transperency in times were APIs can be down for days e.g. by high bot network usage.

(Note the database was reset before the IG cut off date 21. September to ensure that no guild is punished for potential misconfiguration in the beginning of the month. Hence, data is only available from this time)


### OneApi
OneApi is up and running again and now supports Atomic Assets as well.

### (Planned) NFT Game
We are actively planning a NFT game (nothing that will gain us points this month), but further details will be released soon.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

I like the new GitHub submissions of the past months, however I am still unsatisfied with the results in the Notion document. Especially scrolling down all the way to see the latests table makes it annoying to use.
