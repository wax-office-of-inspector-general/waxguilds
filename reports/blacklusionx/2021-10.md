History and Hyperion are up. In the first days, we were experimenting with rate limitations but now the service should be accessible for normal request loads

### Validationcore
https://validationcore.blacklusion.io/

Last month we released the uptime statistics. We got some complaints that the statistics are not representative enough, since the validationcore was running into the rate limits and classifying the endpoint as not working in the statistics. Last month we were validating every 10mins. Increasing the validations to a 30min or 1hour interval was not an option for us, since we see the short validationinterval as a unique advantage over other validators. We solved the rate limitation issue with the following two steps:
1. Running a second instance of the validationcore on a different server and synchronizing the validation rounds between the servers, while storing the data in a single database. Every server validates only every 30mins. This results in a validation every 15mins, while decreasing the load to 1/3 from a single IP address (compared to last month's version).
2. Adding additional delays between requests. Before the validationcore was limiting the requests to 1/sec. Now we increased this to 1/10secs. In some cases a validation can now take up to nearly 30mins. We believe that 1 request every 10secs is a realistic rate, that every endpoint should be able to handle and not trigger realistic/appropriate rate limit settings. Although, we are open for discussion on this.

This month we were testing a lot of the settings and therefore reset the database on the 21. October to not punish guilds in the statistics for us potentially hitting their rate limits during the month. We also checked all the validations manually one-by-one and contacted guilds that were having our IPs in their jails, asking to remove (not whitelist) our IPs from the jails, that might have been banned due to older versions hitting the rate limits. This way the validations and statistics should deliver fair and representative results in the future.

Additionally, we added responsive support for the website. We changed the chart library from Visx to Recharts. We improved the main page of the website: Now featuring a network overview. We added reports for working endpoints: This list takes all the validations from the past 1hour and an endpoint will only be considered healthy if it is working for the full hour. We made some additional small UI/UX improvements. We added 1 additional check for Hyperion, History and Atomic each. We optimized the SSL validation to decrease the load on the guilds' infrastructure further.

We also offer a public GraphQL Api for all the data in our database. This can be used to build your own tools without running your own instance or just e.g. getting a list of working endpoints.

### OneApi
https://wax.oneapi.dev

This month we had around 8 million requests. 2.44million in the past week

![OneApi stats](https://github.com/Blacklusion/guild-submissions/blob/810d76e975cf6294556afeb5b11d68a1ad7c6c19/2021%20October/screenshot-1.png "OneApi stats")

This month we added 3 dedicated servers for the OneApi service. These act as probes to determine the response times of the endpoints. These values are used to determine to which load balancing zone the servers should be added.

With the current traffic on WAX, OneApi is unfortunately only as good as the public endpoints and their rate limits. We do our best to always deliver a response and we have multiple systems to enforce this, however depending on the current circumstance we cannot guarantee this. We are working on a version of OneApi that offers a selection of private endpoints that can guarantee a valid response every single time.

### NFT Game
This month our game moved from the concept phase to the "In development" phase. We onboarded a character designer, a game designer and we are talking with an additional game designer in order to work on the balancing in the game and to implement the game. We are also actively seeking help for the frontend implementation.

The game will be based in an animal wildlife setting. For now, we decided to not release any further information about the game publicly. More information was/will be provided to the IGs.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

Having the guild Ratings on Notion is still not optimal.
