# Blacklusion November 2021 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

Blacklusion

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

This month we decided to start a major rework of our infrastructure. The rework is already in progress and it will keep us busy for the next weeks. We ordered a couple of servers that still need to arrive. This month we went back to the drawing board and decided to not only expand our existing infrastructure but rather to replace most of it by abandoning existing servers and freshly setting up new ones.

Current Rate Limits: Burst of 64 requests is allowed. First 32 without delay before they are limited to 2request/second

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://validationcore.blacklusion.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
 - We added the location data (Longitude and latitude) to the database allowing to show the endpoints on a map in the future. We created a new deployment of the validationcore: ![Validationcore deployment](https://github.com/Blacklusion/guild-submissions/blob/f2f8c415416dd400ab791d69a6cd84ba40a9adf7/2021%20November/image-1.png "Validationcore deployment") Now the validationcore is hosted from 5 servers dedicated solely to the Validationcore instead of being hosted from two of our dedicated servers. This decouples the validationcore and prevents any possible side effects. The goal is not to DDOS the guilds, but rather to simulate real traffic and validate the endpoints. Previously we had two instances running. Now we have 4. This means, that requests are only sent every 20seconds to the same endpoint (previously every 10secs). In our opinion this is a realistic amount of requests, although we are open for discussion on this. The new servers are freshly setup and we validate from four new IPs, meaning that guilds, which may have blocked our IPs due to older versions hitting rate limits should not get punished for this in the statistics. This should ensure accurate results for the Statistics
 - We also started working on a new frontend this month. It is not finished yet. However, we believe that we can further improve the UX by adding a sidemenu and changing some of the components. The new version of the website will go live shortly:

### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://wax.oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
 - Our OneApi landingpage is in work as well:  ![OneApi website](https://github.com/Blacklusion/guild-submissions/blob/35a6d3ea0bb07634fa173b1e866a73087276cce6/2021%20November/image-3.png "OneApi website")
 - As mentioned in the infrastructure section: We are adding servers to our infrastructure, with the purpose to further improve OneApi. Our Paid Api services will also be easily available through OneApi, allowing for an easy integration.
 - Current setback: We might need to rename the service, since there is another company called OneApi. So far this was not a problem. But since we are now branding our api services under this name, we want to avoid conflicts in the future.


### Project AlchemyTribe
- **Description: NFT based breeding and exploration game featuring an alchemy theme**
- Link: https://blacklusion.gitbook.io/alchemytribe/
- Development Stage: Under development

 - The game UI makes major progress as well. However, we are still not satisfied with the current look. Unfortunately this takes longer than anticipated.

No

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We wrote an article giving an overview over the current project guilds have been working on in the last ~4weeks:
https://twitter.com/blacklusion/status/1463200525223178246?s=20

We published a separate medium article and shared it on Twitter:

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

Having the guild Ratings on Notion is still not optimal. Just moving the tables that show the evaluation to the top of the page would already improve the usability a lot
