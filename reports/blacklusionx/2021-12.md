# Blacklusion January 2021 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**

First I would like to give some more insights into the company’s operations. In the past, we have stayed pretty silent about what is going on behind the scenes. This is something I would like to change for the future and be more transparent about our current status and vision independently from specific product updates:

When I joined the WAX Blockchain in mid of 2020 I was the sole employee managing all the infrastructure and product development. This was working great for 2020, as we saw the initial release of the Validationcore and OneApi, while having all major API services up and running.

In the first half of 2021, I moved temporarily from Germany to Finland. Unfortunately, this impacted the guild’s operations since my time was divided between the company and my activities at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland.
Since mid of 2021, I am living in Germany again and my time efforts are not split anymore. Since then I have started reworking the company.

The first step involved fixing our already available product offerings and guild infrastructure which suffered in the first half of the year. This step is nearly completed with the rewrite of the validationcore and release of the standalone statistics website. Our Guild Infrastructure was upgraded and our Hyperion is running. We are still in the process of adding more servers in different geographical locations.

As a next step we want to focus on the company structure and growth: This involves hiring new employees and restructuring the company as an entity. Currently, we have 2 people (besides me) working full-time on product development (both were onboarded in the past 2 months). This involves one React Frontend developer (Validationcore and NFT Game Frontend) and one Graphic designer (lead graphic designer for Game Assets). Multiple other people are assisting the team when needed: 1 UI/UX designer, 2 Game Designers, 1 more Graphic Designer and 1 Landing Page designer. These people are helping us out but do not have a full-time position, so I wouldn’t count them to the core team.

One thing I would like to transparently point out is the use of our guild rewards. We did liquefy some of our obtained producer rewards, however, these remained on our company controlled bank accounts or were used to purchase new equipment and pay wages of the other people. In fact, I personally did not take out money from the company until last month. Even that was only a small Christmas bonus. I am mentioning this to emphasize the focus we have on growth over simple value extraction. With the increased WAX price we are looking forward to reinvesting the rewards into the growth of our company and new products for the WAX ecosystem that are currently under development.

For the future you can expect the following from our guild:
1. Expanding to different chains - An expansion to other EOSIO chains is planned and already in progress. This will greatly benefit our operation since we are more independent from a single chain.
2. Repositioning as an “Infrastructureguild” - With the validation offerings, we have learned a lot about infrastructures and APIs. Over the next months, we will double down on our infrastructure and start offering paid plans for our APIs. In addition, we will keep providing technical statistics and insights.
3. Shifting towards direct B2B and B2C products. In 2020 & 2021 our main idea was to assist by offering technical products such as the pager telegram bot and OneApi. For 2022, we will shift our focus to more direct product offerings, such as building NFT based games that are directly targeted towards the community and help to bring in new members.
4. A more open communication - This week I had a call with Josep. And I would like to have a couple of more calls also with the other IGs in the upcoming weeks, so I can give you some updates on our Game and answer any remaining questions regarding the other projects of our guild.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We now offer a fully indexed 3.3 Hyperion:
- https://hyperion.wax.blacklusion.io

The data from our validationcore (e.g. a list of working Api Endpoints) can be retrieved over our two api endpoints:

- https://wax.validationcore.io/graphql
- https://wax-test.validationcore.io/graphql

Current Rate Limits: Burst of 64 requests is allowed. First 32 without delay before they are limited to 2request/second

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
   ![Validationcore website refresh](https://github.com/Blacklusion/guild-submissions/blob/ced5cb0fb3700c6de8db12971d7285aa08e799ba/2021%20December/image-1.png "Validationcore website refresh")
  - This month we deployed the newest version of our validtioncore website. The new features include:
    - Complete remake of the styling
    - A new navigation
    - Better responsive support
    - Feature filtering in the GuildList: The user can now show/hide guilds after certain criteria
    - Time filtering in the GuildList: Custom date ranges can be set to view statistics. Currently this is only available in the Guild Overview. Our developer is working on this feature for the guild specific statistic sites.
  - We also changed our API scheme. The new scheme is cleaner by making use of Enums and removing the chainname as a parameter that was needed before:
    - https://wax.validationcore.io/graphql
    - https://wax-test.validationcore.io/graphql
  - In case you want to verify the code's accuracy: You can find the codebase here:
    - https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
    - https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore-api
    - https://github.com/michaeljyeates/eosio-protocol (running a customized version for P2P validation)


### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://wax.oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
  - We were waiting for the Validationcore API updates (released this month) to make some changes to the behaviour (planned for the upcoming weeks)
  - Additionally we were waiting for our Hyperion (up and running since this month). Now we host all major API ourselves again. This means that we can start with the roll out of the private endpoints to the OneApi network.


### Project AlchemyTribe
- **Description: NFT based breeding and exploration game featuring an alchemy theme**
- Link: https://blacklusion.gitbook.io/alchemytribe/
- Development Stage: Under development
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
  - The main concept of this game is to push more engaging gameplay. We believe that current blockchain games often have very simple gameplay and by creating a game that has breeding as one of the core mechanics we want to create a game that has a strategy-type component to it. All content in the late game such as the expeditions, primal generation and more are dependent on the specific traits of the animals. That way the player needs to make strategic decisions throughout the progress of the game and simple button clicking will not be enough.
  - Currently, the UI/UX design is a blocker for us. We have a very specific idea of how we want the frontend to look, but could not yet find a designer to realize this. We went over multiple iterations with different designers, without a final model. Currently the UI looks too childish and is lacking some needed depth and complexity to create a more immersive gaming experience. Just recently we added a dedicated UI illustrator to the project. She will create the necessary assets. That way the UI/UX designer can solely focus on layout and not design. This, takes longer than anticipated and delayed the frontend implementation.
    ![Major UI iterations](https://github.com/Blacklusion/guild-submissions/blob/ced5cb0fb3700c6de8db12971d7285aa08e799ba/2021%20December/image-2.png "Major UI iterations")
  - Since the last update, we also switched our head graphic designer. I am really excited about this change since the new assets have a much more suitable styling and we are progressing much faster on the graphic design than in the prior months.
 ![Animal designs](https://github.com/Blacklusion/guild-submissions/blob/c5840a8afadea09134664deaffb4d8408d722a63/2021%20December/image-3.png "Animal designs")
  - We experienced some setbacks on the project as described above. However, we are still looking to release the game in Q1 of 2022. I am happy to have a call with the IGs to go into more specifics and answer any questions about this project.
