# Blacklusion January + February 2022 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**

First I would like to give some more insights into the general Guild operations before moving into the specific categories. As we have been making a lot changes to the company and its operations, I would like to give a transparent status updates:
- [x] Rewrite Validationcore
- [x] Launch standalone Valiationcore website
- [x] Host Hyperion API
- [x] Hire People and make guild less prone to effects of me personally
- [x] OneApi improvements
- [ ] Reinforcing infrastructure (major progress, not quite done yet)
- [ ] Hiring dedicated DevOps employee responsible for Infrastructure and Paid API service
- [ ] Legal changes to the Company, including a dedicated sub-company for Game Development
- [ ] Launch of Paid Api Service
- [ ] Launch of NFT Game



## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Our Hyperion cluster had some downtime this month. As you can see, we have resolved these issues and the Hyperion cluster is online for the past 7days:
https://hyperion.wax.blacklusion.io


https://wax.validationcore.io/stats/guild/blacklusionx?daterange=7d

This month we have been investing a lot of efforts into our CI/CD pipelines. This is of course nothing that will show immediate effects, however, our goal is to have long-term code quality and productivity improvements. We have set up multiple pipelines that automatically build and deploy docker images. For example, our Validationcore website is now always auto deployed whenever we merge into the release branch.

Unfortunately, we are also affected by the chip we are still waiting to move some servers from one supplier to another. This affects mostly our Hyperion and our Chain Api.

This month we also have been working on a High Availability Prometheus deployment. The custom exporters are already written and first tests have been successful. Within the next days we will spin up a dedicated Monitoring Kubernetes cluster. This will be 100% independent from our normal Infrastructure. Until now we have been monitoring our Infrastrcutre via Netdata. From the new deployment we hope to have a more finegrained control over the alerts and metrics. The exporters and cluster are created by an external professional. This will be the basis for our future plans in the Infrastructure sector.

The data from our validationcore (e.g. a list of working Api Endpoints) can be retrieved over our two api endpoints:

- https://wax.validationcore.io/graphql
- https://wax-test.validationcore.io/graphql

Current Rate Limits: Burst of 64 requests is allowed. First 32 without delay before they are limited to 2request/second

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
   - Besides some internal code quality improvements we also implemented the following features:
Date filtering for guildStatistics: https://wax.validationcore.io/stats/guild/blacklusionx?daterange=7d
   - Sometime in the last weeks we added longitude and latitude data. This month everything was revolving around the use of this data. We added maps to the Reports page. For us it was important to not just have some markers on a Google Maps, since we were planning to have custom overlays in the future.
https://wax.validationcore.io/reports/nodes/seed

   ![Report Map](https://github.com/Blacklusion/guild-submissions/blob/76734e6da3757a7c221b450481a1241432a5b176/2022%20January%20+%20February/image-1.png "Report Map")
   - This month we also developed a feature I am really excited about. On the telegram channels, people were frequently asking after endpoints in a certain region. Our new feature allows you to just place a marker on the map (or use your current location). Then all endpoints within a certain radius will be shown on the map and a list is created on-demand that can be copied or downloaded:
https://wax.validationcore.io/services/node-finder

   ![Node Finder](https://github.com/Blacklusion/guild-submissions/blob/76734e6da3757a7c221b450481a1241432a5b176/2022%20January%20+%20February/image-2.png "Node Finder")
   - The validationcore has been awfully slow in the past, giving an overall worse UX than it should be. We found a backend developer who usually works on Cloudflare’s databases and we hired him on a Project base (not full-time, just for a couple of tasks). The results are basically completely rewritten SQL queries and much faster response times. Certain queries are resolved instantly, while the getGuilds query (creating an overview of guilds) still takes 1-3seconds (down from 8-12+ seconds). For my taste this is still to long, we will see what we can do about that. As of writing this report these changes are still only local, as we didn’t get the results I was hoping for on that one query. Tomorrow I freed up some time for this and I looking into releasing the new database changes at the end of the day.
  - We also have a Pull Request Open that adds Filtering for Nodes. This will we be added on the Reports Page and on the Node Finder. Then you will be able to only get endpoints e.g. with SSL or even with a specific wax version.
     ![Node Filter](https://github.com/Blacklusion/guild-submissions/blob/76734e6da3757a7c221b450481a1241432a5b176/2022%20January%20+%20February/image-3.png "Node Filter")
- **Planned roadmap**:
  - Call with you guys: We are serious about the validationcore and I believe it has a lot of potential for WAX, delivering easy-to-use tools. However, it will only be as good as the data itself. I would like to further discuss that on a call, so we are on the same page.
  - Time machine feature. Even though technically not officially supported, you can already request any validation from the database:
https://wax.validationcore.io/validations/cb2fd248-7bff-4c2a-aa6f-9012992311b0
(note that this shows the validation for 2021-11-29 19:23:38.891679) Our goal is to make this much more user-friendly and accessible. We have talked about a query with the backenddev that will count the number of errors per validation and when a user requests a validation from a certain day, we will serve the validation with the most issues (out of the 96 validations per day per guild), since this validation has the highest density of information. This feature will be added in the form of a slider, allowing the user to easily switch between dates.
  - Maps per guild: Showing the distribution of a single guilds infrastructure
We are currently talking with a Kubernetes specialist and we are investigating if it makes sense to deploy on Kubernetes. Currently, my feeling is that it won’t make sense, but we will see.
More statistics: As hinted before, there are some metrics that could still show some interesting insights:
     - Heatmap showing frequency of certain HTTP codes per endpoint
     - Chain wide availability statistics: Overlaying the different statistics for a single type. This would be helpful to see the impacts of e.g. the OVH network outage as we experienced a couple of weeks back
     - Response time: How long does it take for a guild to fix an issue (although this seems hard to implement, especially with the volatility of e.g. Seed Nodes)
  - Show EOSMechanics statistics
  - Integrated Snapshot service. We are planning to offer a snapshot service again and allow the user to download snapshots for Chain nodes and Atomic Dumps.


### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://wax.oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
  - This month we have been doing a lot of testing with the OneApi system. In particular, I have been testing how it behaves regarding rate limits, since if it is proxied through Cloudflare the servers receive it from a Cloudflare IP and not from the user’s IP, potentially hitting rate limits faster. Even though this is still an issue, it is actually less of an issue than initially anticipated.
  - This month I also rewrote the complete codebase from Javascript to Typescript, preparing further rollout.
  - As mentioned before, we are planning to have tight integration with OneApi and our own infrastructure. We believe that blockchain should be easily accessible, thats why we are planning to have all of our API accessible over a single endpoint, including single swagger documentation for Chain, Hyperion and Atomic.
  - Now that we have a Hyperion cluster again, we are coming this step closer and closer, since we are now hosting all major API types ourselves.
  - We have reached some important milestones within the last time (new Validationcore API schema (released a couple of weeks back), Typescript rewrite and hosting of all Api Types. Now we can move into the next phase of the product, including:
- **Planned roadmap**:
  - Rebranding of OneApi to another name, since we could run into trademark issues with OneApi (next weeks)
  - Launch of a dedicated Landing Page (next weeks).
  - Once these two steps are completed, we will also more aggressively promote it in groups etc.
  - Launch of Paid API service. This will be accessible over a similar domain structure but 100% handled by us. Our plan is to have it on a pay-as-you-go model. E.g. a fixed price per million requests.



### NFT Game
- **Description: Character Centered Metaverse**
- Link: (old concept) https://blacklusion.gitbook.io/alchemytribe/
- Development Stage: Under development
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
   - This month we made some major changes to the game:
      - Recap: The old concept allowed the user to breed animals and to create unique combinations. The user could breed multiple species with each other, e.g. Lion + Bear = LionBear. It was set in the Alchemy theme and had some cool mechanics. The user could send the animals on missions and yield items, tokens etc.
      - The problem I was seeing with such game(s), is that such a project is limited for future expandability. The more we were developing on the game the more cool things we found we could have done with these characters. However, since the game was already targeted towards a highly specific niche additional expansions felt unnatural. Because of that, I made the decision to discard the old concept and keep only the breeding aspects.
      - The new Concept is now in 3D instead of 2D. That is something I was missing on WAX before in general. Now the user will be able to create their characters after the same breeding concepts. However, the characters are not limited to animals anymore. It can be anything and the combination are more open.
      - The characters are only the central part. The actual gameplay will be realized in a set of games based on these characters. We are hoping to create an ecosystem that holds value instead of single projects that experience a hype phase.
      - The idea is that each character has 3 Placeholder traits. These traits are independent of appearance. However, in the gameplay aspect, these traits can be mapped to any functionality. For example, if we would release a fighting game we could map Trait1 to Attack, Trait2 to Defense, Trait3 to Special. In a racing game, we could map it to Speed, Acceleration, Handling etc. We believe that such multi rarity system is a really interesting concept, that brings some more dimension into crypto games
      - I know that it can be easy for projects to just be “underdevelopment” for ages. As requested before I would like to have a call with you guys, so you can ask any questions you have regarding the projects and I can go over some internal documents etc. It is really important that we are on the same page with this one. I believe that changing the game concept after weeks of development was the correct decision, but I understand that it can be hard to estimate without much information about the old project.
   - In particular, we have been working on a new landing page (don’t be irritated by the name, its just a placeholder). The designer is located in Ukraine. We were also planning to have the OneApi landing page in this month's report, but because of that, we were not able to finish that either.
https://www.figma.com/file/T5SYrOVCogmWZICU0pbxkd/Chibbies?node-id=0%3A1
   - We have started creating the new UI, so we can move on to implementing it ASAP. It is currently still in the phase of creating rough wireframes and investigating the best layout:
https://www.figma.com/file/w5qvPK4LDVhqgfN6n327wu/Omega-UX?node-id=0%3A1
   - Additionally, I will also send you our internal 15-page Game Design Document per email. It is just a rough write-up outlining the project, hence I don’t want to have it public quite yet. A fully-fledged whitepaper will be developed with it as a basis
   - Additionally, we are looking to get the community more involved. Last week liquidstudio was already kind enough to take some time to chat about certain issues we will run into with our Unity implementation. Another call with Waxsweden is planned within the next time, hoping to talk more to the whole NFT community etc. Currently, we are also planning to spin up a discord server, to get some more quality input from the community themselves. But this is still something that yet has to happen.
   - In the last report, I mentioned that we changed the lead artist. The old artist was still involved a bit. We laid her off completely and instead another game artist has joined the team yesterday. We are still searching for a 3D artist and continuing with 2D concept arts
   - We have invested into some new equipment, including color calibrating devices for our displays
