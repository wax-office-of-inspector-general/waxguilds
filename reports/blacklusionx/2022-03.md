# Blacklusion January + February 2022 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We have updated our delphioracle script to push 3 datapoints per minute.
We have upgraded our presence on the Testnet, we now offer the following services on the Testnet:
- SeedNode
- Chain Api Node
- History v1 (new)
- Hyperion v2 (new)
- Atomic Assets Node (new)
- delphioracle with 3 datapoints per minute (new)
On testnet we are also testing a new NGINX configuration. Our guild strongly believes that blockchain should become easier to use, hence we are trying to improve the overall UX where we can. For us this also means simplifying how API calls can be made. All API calls can be made to single url: https://testnet.wax.blacklusion.io

We are actually already testing a similar configuration on the Mainnet as well. We still did not make the transition fully, but this month we have switched to an architecture that features a dedicated proxy server to better balance traffic and fight bots. You can already make e.g. atomic requests to our hyperion Endpoint. We are still waiting for servers we ordered multiple weeks back. Once they are delivered we will transition our endpoints fully and also offer a single endpoint for Mainnet.

We had some Hyperion downtime due to constant abuse during the month. This is fixed now. Same for Atomic Assets.

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
  - There were actually a lot of small changes, that are probably to boring to cover in the report: e.g. we added the chain logo to the chain selector in the button left corner
  - Timeline: We have a branch open that adds a timeline feature to the validatoncore, that allows to show older validations. On average we validate 96times per day. The timeline allows to automatically show the validation with the most errors of that day, since that has the highest density of information in our eyes. However, this can also be turned off and you can browse all available validations. This feature is not live yet. However, since the call with the IGs we have reimplmented the backend queries, so these are 100x faster now. It remains some additional testing and to support the new queries in the frontend.
  - Seed validation rewrite: We had a situation that the seed validation was not working as expected anymore. This has likely to do with the deployment in the cloud. We have rewritten this part of the code and we have created an independent microservice for seed validtion. This way the seed nodes are validated from our dedicated servers, while all of the validation logic and normal http requests are performed in the cloud.
  - Node Tester: During the refactoring of the Seednode Validation we added the possibility to trigger a validation and to receive the logs in realtime as a stream. With this new feature we have added a page to the validationcore that allows to validate seed nodes directly in your browser. This is useful since a simple ping or telnet command does not really say much about the functioning of a seednode. I already read this question a dozen times in telegram chats as well. Now you can just validate in your browser, without needing to add it to your bp.json etc, so it also works great for unlisted endpoints. This works for both mainnet and testnet. https://wax.validationcore.io/services/node-tester (if you want to try it you can use peer1.wax.blacklusion.io:4646). I am really happy how the user experience turned out
  - We added the network info page. Especially when you are new to the chain it is annoying to find the genesis.json and chainId sometimes, so we added these for mainnet and testnet https://wax.validationcore.io/services/network-info
  - config.ini support: in lists where seed nodes are listed we added a small toggle that changes the format from text to config.ini to allow direct copying into the config.ini file. On the node finder the endpoints are also sorted after distance now. https://wax.validationcore.io/services/node-finder
- **Planned roadmap**:
  - We talked about this in the call. For the near future we will focus on:
    - Deploying the Timeline branch
    - Adding more Graphs Especially http heatmaps.
  - On our list are also additional features such as:
    - push api test
    - Delphi oracle test
    - Double producing stats
    - Integration of EOS Mechanic stats
    - Validation oracle smart contracts and decentralized validation

### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://wax.oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
  - We created a Stripe account and started a sample implementation that automatically bills the user if requests are made. As we believe blockchain should be easy to use, we want to offer a "Pay as you Go" model that just bills the user for every 1mio requests. The user can sign up and an API Key is automatically created without any human intervention. He/she can add a credit card to his account and is billed monthly. Although we are also planning to offer "dedicated nodes" for dApps etc, we want to make it as easy as possible for new users to find a reliable endpoint which is easy to use and has affordable pricing. We do not want that people need to write us on telegram and wait etc.

  - We also started creating the admin panel for OneApi in TypeScript, React and TailwindCSS.

### NFT Game
- **Description: Character Centered Metaverse**
- Development Stage: Under development
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
  - We spent a lot of time thinking through the information architecture and user flow of the platform:
    https://www.figma.com/file/w5qvPK4LDVhqgfN6n327wu/Omega-UX?node-id=0%3A1
  - We have started with UI/UX Figma model. Don't be irritated about the rainbow colors. That is changing. The UI/UX designer is externally and was unfortunately on vacation some parts of this month:
    https://www.figma.com/file/grbbhfoXrzkn5s1NxiJta4/HOME-page?node-id=0%3A1
  - We went through a couple of iterations of the landing page and settled on the design. The implementation is already finished. Some minor fixes and replacement of assets still remain:
    https://winde.space/chibbies/
  - From the graphical site of the game we had a lot of discussion about the proportions and features of the characters. This was a major blocker so far, since changes would also affect the breeding contracts etc. But luckily we have settled on this in this month.
  - One big uncertainty was also the 3D designer. We have found a couple of designers that would suit the game and team. We still need to figure out some specifics about the contract etc, but thats all. They have done custom designs for us. I will share them here as well. As you can see its actually a broccoli character. We chose this, since the game will also feature all kinds of characters, not only animals, also food, objects and more. We wanted to try around with this as well. You can see the overall styling we are going for: Smooth and simple textures and clean lines. This is just the first iterations, so of course the final product will be of much higher quality and some things still need to change: e.g. no face tattoos, proportions etc. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KOhpPD8DID0GXWgq0OJpw_AbquEJYU6-?usp=sharing
  - We also have started the implementation of the smart contracts and creation of the NFT collection. For that we have built a small site and custom api that creates characters on    demand: https://dev.omega.blacklusion.io/preview. These are not the final characters and this is more for internal use to get a better understanding when creating the breeding contracts. We also have deployed NFTs on the testnet https://wax-test.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/blklsnxtests



## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

No

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
We opened 3 Pull Requests on the WAX Documentation:
1. Restructuring the assets in the repo, as I see this becoming an issue the bigger the docu gets: https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/wax-developer/pull/32
2. Add chains.json, bp.json explaination and wax block producer section in the sitebar: https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/wax-developer/pull/31
3. Add custom permissions article, covering how to create permissions using bloks.io and a lot of images: https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/wax-developer/pull/33

Sorry, that I added this so late, but I only got the idea after the recent discussion in the Network Governance channel. I thought in such case it would be cool to just link the official documentation.

We will keep publishing a report on our social media:
https://twitter.com/blacklusion/status/1498431742889410564?s=20&t=o6fDb8wfRLyCK-jn-iTR8A


## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

No
