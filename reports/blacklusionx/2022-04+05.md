# Blacklusion May 2022 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We have changed our main producer node. This has normalized our transaction count per block and drastically improved the aloha graphs as well.

I already explained this to Rakeden in DM: Our Hyperion cluster experienced some outage during 5 - 10May. This was due to constant abuse of alien.worlds queries (as we offer a full data cluster). We have ordered additional hardware about 2days after the first abuse, which got delivered a couple of days later. The cluster was up and running again from there on, however our validationcore shows some slight dips in uptime after the 10th. This was again due to abuse, that was always fixed by us within a single day. We always kept fair rate limits instead of agressivley blocking abusers. 

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
    - TIMELINE added: We added a new timeline feature allowing to view historical validaitons. When implementing this feature it was really important for us, to deliver a great UX and the highest density of information. Because of that we have added the "smart validation" feature. This feature picks the validation automatically with the most errors of a day (as we believe this has the highest density of information). This can of course also be turned off and then the user can pick from all validations (average of 96 validations per day per guild)
    - Improvements: We have deployed new code to the backend that now sends slack notifications if errors should appear and some other improvements have been made to the backend. Not so exciting to show of, but worth mentioning as it was costing quite some time.
    - We also added multiple new chart features to the website (It is in the codebase put not exposed). We now have all the chart libraries ready for producer benchmarks and http treemaps. The backend is the current bottleneck. We will need to prepare the queries to populate these graphs. 


### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://wax.oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
  - This month we have proceeded with our efforts in creating an easy to use api-as-a-service. Especially the setup costs and fixed costs is something we would like to ditch for our customers. This month, we have been actively texting people, that were asking for api services via DM and we have found atleast one or two, that are interested in participating in a first version of the pay-as-you-go model. We are ready to move to the next phase. The first tests are set for the beginning of next week, so the next major milestone is just around the corner. 


### NFT Game
- **Description: Character Centered Metaverse**
- Development Stage: Under development
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
  - In the call we briefly touched this as well. I would like to go a bit deeper into the development status, as I believe there were some questions surrounding the project:
    - This project could be structured into 3 different projects:
        1. **Gaming platform**: Imagine Steam but for blockchain gaming
        2. **Breeding Game & Character Framework**: The creation of 3D characters that can be bred and then be used in other games as a skin
        3. **Games built on top of our Breeding game**.
    
    1. **(Platform)** As I said in the call we are looking to launch before the NFT NYC (June 21) the platform. So you can expect some working version open to the public very soon. The Figma is coming along (I am really happy how the UI/UX is turning out, I believe UI/UX is often overlooked with blockchain apps (not only WAX)).
    https://www.figma.com/file/grbbhfoXrzkn5s1NxiJta4/OMEGA-UI?node-id=0%3A1
    
        We also started the development of the frontend in parallel. There are still some screens that need to be designed in the Figma, but we would like to launch the platform soon, hence we have already started implementing the logic. So far the basic navigation, user authentication, querying and displying of user information including the NFTs owned by a player are working. The current master branch will be published here: dev.omega.blacklusion.io
        
        We have created a custom Atomic Api Ingestion Pipeline. We currently have tested this on the testnet only, but basically this allows us to run new queries, that show more in-depth stats about NFTs. Since our game is dependent on the breeding of characters, we want to give the users the possibility to see e.g. "5% of all characters have this trait". This query was designed with our collection in mind, but technically also supports all other collections. That way people can actually see how rare their rare NFT is. For this we needed to query all NFTs of a collection to create these overviews. It is realized via a materialized view in the postgres database. For about 10mio NFTs on the Testnet it took 5mins to refresh the view, so we will have to see how the performance scales to the number of NFTs on WAX Mainnet. We are not aiming to build another NFT Marketplace directly, but there will be usecases on our platform to display NFTs and additional data.
    
        We have created custom smart contracts for the platform. These smartcontracts will allow game developers to register a game on our standard. That way all the game data can be pulled from the chain (+ IPFS).
        https://wax-test.bloks.io/account/blkdeveloper
    
        We have creted a custom graphQL Api serving game information and stats. To be honest, this Api is currently still under development, hence some parts are working some not. The api can already pull stats from the chain, such as NFT secondary volume and number of Wallets interacting with the smart contracts. Additionally it can also pull data such as discord members and twitter followers. You've guessed it, our goal is to offer some more comprehensive stats (like dappradar) that allow players to find new games and make their decisions not only blockchain stats but also other metrics.
    
    2. **(Breeding Game)** We were really close to signing a dedicated 3D designer for our company, however he chickened out in the last moment. We have found a new 3D designer since then and we are making progress here (but this cost us about 2weeks). You can see in the attachements some of the first renders. There are still some improvements to be made, but you see the direction we are heading.

        Also, I would like to mention that the current state of the project is set to have around 160,000 unique characters. Of course this will be done generative. However, because of the complexity we are spending a lot of time on planning the shared framework etc. This month, we also have spent a lot of time and research on the color system. Our goal is to give every character a primary color. But to create more interest we need a secondary and ternary color as well. But from a UX standpoint we believe that it is too frustrating to keep track of 3 colors during breeding. As the result would basically be completely random color combiniations all the time. Because of this we have decided to calculate the 2. and 3. color out of the 1. color using some color magic such as complementary colors etc.
        https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO3V4pjo=/?share_link_id=436833217636
    
        We have started on the Unity Implementation of our Character SDK. This SDK will be able to query the characters owned by a player and convert the NFTs into 3D characters that can be used in the game. It will be accessible to other developers as well. This is still in the early stages, hence not fully working (more Unity stuff in the next section)
    
    3. For a **first game** we would like to create a game showcasing the characters. We believe that blockchain gaming is missing some of the fun that traditionally games offer, that just cannot be offered by clicking 1 button and claiming. Hence we have taken a different approach and we have decided to create an endless runner game, in which the player needs to avoid obstactles with his character. It is a game purely based on skill. This of course will not be the only game we are planning to release, but for the first game we wanted to set the complexity to a reasonable level, to first focus on everything surrounding the characters and platfrom and not to be stuck in the development stage for ages. So stay tuned for some more complex game mechanics in future games. But this will be a first fun implementation using our characters, Unity SDK and Platform. There are still some adjustments we are looking to make: In needs to get harder and become more challenging. Also some graphical improvements are planned (character is currently a placeholder). But enjoy the latest working build of the game here:

### Prometheus Exporter
- **Description: Expose metrics to prometheus for monitoring purposes for chain, atomic and hyperion nodes**
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/eosio-prometheus-exporter
- **News / Updates**:  
  - Setting up Prometheus as a guild is crucial. However especially for new guilds it is very hard to setup a new prometheus instance, since you don't know which metrics to monitor and how to export them. When we were setting up our prometheus cluster we did not find much information or any up-to-date exporters. Thats why we have decided to open source them, as we believe it will benefit the whole community. We had someone develop the exporters for us, hence we are releasing them officially as a product as this was/is costing us money. Btw sorry for the late commit but you can see on the file creation date that some of these files were created back on Feb 24. So this is something we have been working on quite a while actually.

### Blacklusion Pager
- **Description: Push notifications from the validationcore**
- Development Stage: Under development
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: -
- **News / Updates**:  
  - I really want to bring the blacklusion pager back, also since other guilds were asking after it. I was even looking to launch it before the deadline, but I postponed it in favor for some more important projects. I just wanted to state that this is something we were actively working on this month. I already have rewritten the sign-up logic and implemented a superior alert system similar to that of the alertmanager of prometheus. We still need to do some more work on the database connections. Not sure if this even eligable for points, just wanted to let you know, that we are also working on bringing this back very very soon (before the next report)


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

No

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
We opened 2 Pull Requests on the WAX Documentation:
1. Add german translation https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/wax-developer/pull/43
2. https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/wax-developer/pull/44

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

As I said before, my opinion as a validator providor is that guilds should whitelist validators and ratelimits should be tested independently. I am happy to have a call with you guys about this. As this is a bit more complex topic.
