# Blacklusion July 2022 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**

Upfront: This month we have traveled to the NFT NYC. It was great meeting some of the other guilds and WAX people in person. Also it shifted our focus for this month more to bizdev than really any other category. We have worked on getting coorperations for our gaming platform.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
Everything was up, only our hyperion/history cluster was getting spammed again with requests, that has impacted the uptime a little. We need to investigate if adding additional nodes in the cluster makes sense / is sustainable with current WAX prices. 

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

  - This month we have started our closed beta for the oneapi api as a service. This is by far the easiest API as a service on the WAX blockchain.
  - You can sign up with your google account then create a project in our dashboard. Then you create an api key for that project and finished. No need to join any telegram chats or get any offers via DM. Everything is transparently explained on our landing page (https://oneapi.dev) and in the app itself. Basically, this can run completely without external help. e.g. if a user leaks their api key they do not have to contact us on telegram but instead they can just regenerate the api key through our dashboard.
  - The billing is done via stripe and automated. You can check your invoices in the billing tab. When creating this project our focus was to make it as easy as possible for private people and new projects to get started on the WAX blockchain. Also, our pricing model takes a more friendly approach than that of other guilds. When creating the pricing we have made sure to not undercut other guilds, as our goal is not really to compete via the prices but via the user experience. Having high upfront setup fees scares away users and is unnecessary in our opinion. The pricing is metered and scales with the project, making it more affordable for smaller projects, but otherwise, the per-request pricing is similar to that of other providers such as dfuse.
  - In our closed beta we currently have 2 projects on the service: They love it and they are constantly asking when we finally release the production version
  - We still need to work on the usage integration that shows more detailed graphs about the usage of the private api, such as requests per country etc. This month we already have spent time on bringing up a separate elastic cluster just for parsing nginx logs that reflect the api usage and create proper stats. This can then be requested by the dashboard and presented to the user. We have run into multiple issues when creating this cluster, as for some reason the pulling of logs is currently not working to the cluster


### Gaming Platform
- **Description: Steam for blockchains**
- Development Stage: Under development
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
    - This month our focus was on the gaming platform. Creating a first working version as well as working on cooperation with other projects and blockchains. We have pitched the project to a lot of other companies at the NFT NYC and we are in active talks with other projects and blockchains to create cross-chain promotions and bring new users to WAX. We were actually surprised of how positive the response for the project was.
    - As for the development progress of the website, you can check the progress here: https://develop--blacklusion-omega.netlify.app/
    - Initially, we wanted to release working code much sooner, but some implementations turned out to be more complicated than initially anticipated and a couple of team members actually got sick.
    - This month we have implemented most of the logic regarding the game pages: Filtering games after categories is working perfectly fine. 
    - The logic of the game details page is working, it shows the marketing material of the games (screenshots etc.), it shows the description of a game. It fully supports markdown and lets game publishers create detailed descriptions of their games (something that is currently missing on WAX)
    - The link to our content management system is working and it pulls content created by us directly
    - The NFT details page is also mostly implemented. We have chosen a different approach than a lot of other WAX NFT pages/marketplaces and we have decided to make the overall layout and design of the NFT page more user-focused rather than technical. The goal is to make NFTs more approachable for Web2.0 users.
    - The Wallet integration is working as well. Users can log in with their blockchain account and access the NFTs they own
    - We also updated the smartcontracts to support the new features: https://wax-test.bloks.io/account/blkdeveloper?loadContract=true&tab=Tables&account=blkdeveloper&scope=blkdeveloper&limit=100
    - We also have started the implementation of the "list your game" page that allows publishers to create a game entity on-chain. It helps the user by validating the data on the client side already.
    - We have started the implementation of a custom ipfs resizer. I know there are some other public versions available but after some testing, they did not deliver the performance needed especially for videos. Currently, the live resizing of images is working fine as well as the caching of already resized images. What is left is the resizing of videos actually. Our resizers have powerful configs for predefined sizes. 

    Planned for next month:
    - Implement NFT browse feature / search
    - Implement user inventory
    - Polish existing pages
    - Create proper branding, naming, custom domain
    - Populate the API data with actual/real data: This is something that will actually launch really soon, as last month we already coded a lot of the statistics logic. This month we have also updated the filler that scans the smartcontracts for new games and parses the on-chain data to a database game entity. What currently is still missing is the logic that triggers the statistics to be updated as well as pushing some initial data into smartcontracts
    - A news page that integrates other news sites such as tokengamer via an RSS feed. This aims to make it easier for users to inform about game projects
    - All in all I am confident that the site will be in a useable state to roll out proper public beta


### Prometheus Exporter
- **Description: Expose metrics to Prometheus for monitoring purposes for chain, atomic and hyperion nodes**
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/eosio-prometheus-exporter
- **News / Updates**:  
    - I just committed the latest version of the exporters

### Blacklusion Pager
- **Description: Push notifications from the validationcore**
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: -
- **News / Updates**:  
    - This month we brought back the blacklusion pager
    - It is a telegram bot that takes all the validation data from the validationcore and creates push notifications for guilds. The new version of the validationcore offers a new system for creating alerts. Previous alerts are stored in a database and only new alerts are sent to the guild. Additionally, this allows the grouping of notifications, meaning a guild will only receive a single message rather than getting spammed if something fails. This is all possible through the historic data of the validationcore.io. For every message, a link to the specific validationcore validation is created and sent along the telegram message. This allows the user to check more details in the browser, even if the validation status has changed since then

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Nothing that will grant points this month probably, but we have connected with a lot of games and chains at the NFT NYC and we are hoping to bring more into this category in the close future.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
No

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
With the current prices, a minimum USD pay would be nice to see. If that is on the agenda, then this should also be implemented sooner than later, to give us more freedom in planning for the future etc.
