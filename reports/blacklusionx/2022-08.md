# Blacklusion August 2022 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
This month we had exceptional uptime for all api types

**How we contributed to the current network "situation"**
We have tried different settings on our producer. For this we have properly unregistered our producer to adjust the peers and greylist settings. We have been following along with the chats since the beginning and when one of the first ideas for a short term fix was published we have checked the graphs (eos nation stats) and checked if they actually have improved the situation. Once pinks performance graph showed improved performance, we have announced to join the guilds that use the greylist method and have changed our producer greylist as well.

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
    - Some minor maintenance this month


### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
    - Our closed beta continues. We currently have 3 subscribers to our api service
    - This month we have been working on the elasticcluster responsible for the usage stats in our backend. Basically the plan is to scrape all nginx logs from the proxy servers and then create realtime stats for the users. e.g. they can see what type of browsers and ips the users are using. We believe that such service is needed, as currently the api as a service experience on WAX is highly dependent on private chats on telegram.


### Gaming Platform
- **Description: Steam for blockchains**
- Development Stage: Under development
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
    - This month we have continued our efforts in creating the best crypto gaming platform. The website is mostly complete actually. You can check out the current state here: 
    https://develop--blacklusion-omega.netlify.app/
    - The website queries all data live from our backends: Atomic data + custom apis.
    - The user can browse and filter! all games registered. 
    - For every game we create a beautiful page, with YouTube video support, markdown support and proper links to all websites and social media.
    - The user can browse all NFTs and filter after certain games and other things
    - The user can check all relevant inforamtion about the NFT via the NFT detail page. It also offers a new and so far unseen chart in the WAX ecosystem. It shows how many NFTs have been burned, are open for sale or in inventory from a specific template. This is actually really helpful as it allows to better understand the usage of the NFT. E.g. the high burnrate of Farmers world NFTs indicate singletime use items: https://develop--blacklusion-omega.netlify.app/assets/wax/atomicassets/1099816361647/
    - We have added a Full text search to the page
    - We have added responsive support for the main pages
    - This month we also have finished the development of our game developer dashboard, that guides game studios through the listing process of games and validates the entries client side. Some cool features are: Users can save a draft and continue later. Full ipfs support. Technically we could deploy all game metadata decentalized
    
    What is left to do before the launch:
    - Design changes (we have a branch open that changes the colors and some other things about the design to make it more balanced and distinctive)
    - Connect our (already developed) new game api version to the website
    - Populate data with actual games: The data that is shown is queried from the backend, it is just mock data at the moment, but everything is working on a technical level. We have already been talking to multiple games (also in direct contact with wax studios) in order to prepare the initial collection of games
    - We expect to officially launch very soon (definetly before the next guild submission)
