**Blacklusion**

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
This month we had some small issues with our Atomic Api, that are resolved. All other systems were operational as in the last months.

We are hosting our own ipfs with resizing now: https://ipfs.blacklusion.cloud/ipfs

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
    - Some minor changes this month
    - There are some bigger changes planned for the next month. We had a call about the validations, and certain checks such as block1 will only become optional. We will also rework the history validations.


### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
    - Our closed beta continues. We currently have 3 subscribers to our api service
    - Last month we said we are working on an ElasticCluster, that was not yet working. This is fully working now. This allows us to scrape all logs and create detailed stats about every api Key. E.g. we can breakdown the user agents, http error codes etc. All these stats are **working** now. We just need to add custom graph components to the dashboard, since these are currently displayed in Kibana and we don't just want to offer a elasticsearch login to the users.
    - Under the hood there has been happening a lot more as well (also related to the gaming platform). We have reworked the off-chain account system. Once live, users can create a Blacklusion ID. With a blacklusion account you can create Projects. Every project can have multiple assets. E.g. you can create a gaming project that is listed on our platform and create an api endpoint for your game. You can invite team mates and assign permissions. This was always planned, but this month we have finished the database scheme for it. Everything works as planned, we still need to add UI components that allow to assign roles etc. But if you e.g. create a project in the dashboard all the objects are already correctly created.


### Gaming Platform
- **Description: Steam for blockchains**
- Development Stage: Under development
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
    - Even thought we have made quite some progress on the platform this month, progress has been slightly slower that I would have liked. You can check the current state here: https://beta.blacklusion.io
    - You can see that all the pages are functional and responsive
    - The main blocker this month were actually the above mentioned database changes. As we were trying to have everything connected, we did not want invite game publishers to list their games before this is fully worked out. But now the new project and permission system is live (besides some missing UI). 
    - We have also finished most of the listing process on the dashboard. You can experience it yourself here: (no need to login in) https://dash.beta.blacklusion.io. You can see that all the inputs are validated on the client side. You can save a draft and keep editing later. You can create a game across multiple chains and assign multiple collections per chain to one game. The latter feature is completely new to the blockchain space in general but of course also to WAX.
    - We are hosting a custom docs page for the project as well: https://docs.beta.blacklusion.io
    - We have invited the first games to list their games in the beginning of next week (17. Oct)
    - We will attend NFT London and we want attend with a functional product with multiple games listed. The main reason holding us back is the absence of a "cool" name. We have already designed a logo hoping to come up with a name that way, but still something were are working on.
    - In general there as been a lot of progress especially on the side of the database. I am happy to supply more detailed schemas and git history on the changes, if there are any questions.

### Prometheus Exporter
- **Description: Expose metrics to Prometheus for monitoring purposes for chain, atomic and hyperion nodes**
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/eosio-prometheus-exporter
- **News / Updates**:  
    - Other guilds are using our exporters

- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Link: - https://t.me/WaxPagerBot

    - We have been using the blacklusion pager ourselves for more testing. Other guilds are using it as well
