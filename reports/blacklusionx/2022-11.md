# Blacklusion October 2022 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
This month all of our apis had exceptional uptime. We actually had a couple of cases, in which we got botted, but abusers were usually blocked within 15mins.

As a reminder we are hosting our own IPFS: https://ipfs.blacklusion.cloud/ipfs

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### General Update
Before diving into the specific products I would like to go a bit deeper into something we have been working on this month, as this affects all projects basically. We have reached the point were we maintain a couple of websites and dashboards. Throughout these projects we have noticed that there is a lot of similar code and similar problems. For that reason we have decided to code our own component library from scratch. This might actually be a bit overkill for now, but we have been looking into the common ones and did not find what we were looking for. The blacklusion Glass UX is built on TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, React, NextJS. We see one of our strengths as a guild in UI/UX, we want to use the component library as a tool to double down on that. As of writing this report we actually already have successfully implemented the base components such as Buttons, Tooltips, Headers etc. and we have published our own NPM modules. I will stop going into further detail to keep this short, but basically we already have seen a major improvement of Maintainability and consistency. We still need to do the migration (which is set for next month) in which we will port the Gaming platform, the Gaming dashboard and the OneApi dashboard to our component library. Validationcore will not be migrated for now. This will allow use to more closely tie our products together and to create a user experience more similar to e.g. Google where you can go from google.com to google mail and from there to google drive. We believe that bringing such UX to blockchain is very important to get those Web2.0 users on board.

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
    - Kaefer reported a bug regarding the Hyperion validation. We traced it down and fixed it
    - We added the option to select a date on the Time machine. So far it was only possible to slide the timemachine slider, but for some better UX, we decided to add a button that opens a small calendar that can be used
    - We added the partial history check. For this we check if the hyperion cluster contains an actions on now() - 42days (6weeks). Hyperions can then be flagged as full or partial. As of writing this report I did not yet deploy the changes in production, as we need to migrate the database, update the frontend and api. This is a bigger task and I want to ensure it is done properly. But in general, I was already running a couple of validation rounds locally with the new features and everythings seems to work so far. Depending on when you read this report it might actually worth checking the wax.validationcore.io website
    - Also I would like to mention at this point: The 29. Nov marks exactly one year of historical data on the Validationcore. With historical data I mean, full historical data, where the full validation with Http error codes and response times can be recreated, not just a binaray works - works not - score


### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
    - As the gaming dashboard is actually based on the original OneApi dashboard we decided to finish the migration to the component library first before we do any additional changes on the frontend side. As this should allow us to apply the changes of the gaming dashboard we have been working on for weeks to the oneapi dashboard as well without major work.
    - Also I would actually like to schedule a call sometime soon regarding OneApi, as we had a rough discussion in one of the calls already regarding a global loadbalancer etc. I do think that a "free" public api could be a major reason for people to choose WAX over other chains, but obviously we as guild would not be able to fund such load just by our guild pay. I would like to discuss the overall plan how this could be integrated into the ecosystem.


### Gaming Platform
- **Description: Steam for blockchains**
- Development Stage: Under development
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
    - We have changed the charting library from the project. The old one created some issues and the new one was also created in a way, that should allow us to implement the charts once for all projects (dashboards and gaming site). The new charts are actually really cool, as they correctly scale all datapoints (e.g. if there is no data in the past 2 months, but the past 6months are selected, it is represented correctly unlike on other sites)
    - We have deployed numerous bug fixes and code quality improvements
    - We have also started listing the first games. This process is actually a LOT more time intensive than initially anticipated, as most games seem to get a lot of marketing requests on a daily basis and some just ignore our requests. As of writing this report we have listed Acryptia and Train of the Century. Keep in mind, that we do not just copy paste information from the Atomic Assets standard, but instead we reach out to every game individually and create a listing together with their marketing team. We are also in contact with these games (and more, but these have replied and agreed to get listed): Starthip, Alien Worlds, ZOS, RealmNFT, WaxelWorld, Blockchain Brawlers, Music Mugul, Axis Zero, Happy Coasters
    - The name is still a big blocker. I actually dedicated 2-3 days just to brainstorming about the name this month, but without success. I think we are getting closer, but I want to make sure that the name is cool, as in my eyes, currently not as much is happening in the crypto space anyways. So I'd rather be in an open beta phase for some time and improve the UI while being so, instead of rushing to get that "released status".

### Prometheus Exporter
- **Description: Expose metrics to Prometheus for monitoring purposes for chain, atomic and hyperion nodes**
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/eosio-prometheus-exporter
- **News / Updates**:  
    - Other guilds are using our exporters

### Blacklusion Pager
- **Description: Push notifications from the validationcore**
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Link: - https://t.me/WaxPagerBot 
- **News / Updates**:  
    - pager should slightly improve as well with the new changes

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

No

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
Yes, we attended the NFT London

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
In general, I would be curious if it might make sense to reward guilds for attending events as well? Of course we wanted to go there with or without points, but attending these conferences is tied to serious financial costs and I seem to always meet the same 2-3 guilds at these events. Spreading the word about WAX should definitely be one of the priorities as currently barely knows of WAX
