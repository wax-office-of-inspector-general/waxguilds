I have uploaded youtube video showing off some of the stuff we have been working on. Of course you will find the information also as written form here, for future reference, but I highly recommend watching the video as that will help to understand what we are up to in general

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
    - Mainly some bugfixes this month. We've been doing some changes to our pager bot. During that we've been doing some changes to the validationcore as well
    - We got some feature requests and we have some new features planned for the future.


### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
    - Lets jump on a call once you also have time. Essentially as you can also see in the video we are really doubling down on the user experience of our products and I believe we are close to bringing some awesome products to WAX. Blacklusion Cloud will be the name of our commercial offering for APIs. The call would essentially be about the state and differentiation to OneApi. Having a load balancer between guilds could be a unique feature for WAX and. If that is from general interest, we are probably one of the most knowledgable guilds on this topic, as we already have build oneapi and the validationcore and are now developing the whole api dashboard with full fledged team permissions and high quality UI/UX.
    - (as shown in the video): This month we have been building on the account system. The current beta uses our old backend. We basically realized that together with the gaming platform it makes sense to unify these into a single system and allow companies / teams to create accounts, assign roles and share projects between members. We are developing it in a way how we can easily base new products on this as well


### Gaming Platform
- **Description: Steam for blockchains**
- Development Stage: Under development
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
    - The gaming platform is in a beta state. You can use it. We are about to deploy a new update fixing some of the stat issues and responsive issues.
    - Honestly the holidays have really slowed down the game listing, as many wanted to have a look at this "in the new year". So we are just picking up where we left off. We already have 2+ more games submitted by game publishers, we have revised their applications, as they currently do not meet the content standards. We also had a call with WAX / Tyranno last week and they will be listing their games soon
    - Name and Branding will be announced soon
    - In general, blacklusion has been building for quite some months and we are really motivated to jump into 2023 with a couple of product releases and get our products out there. So you can expect official releases soon.


### Prometheus Exporter

    - This month we reworked the whole notification management of the pager. Alerts now have a proper description about the issue. also an issue in which a user would be notified about the same issue twice is fixed now.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

No

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
I created two PRs for the developers docs. I translated around 3,300 words to german. Also I had a look at the overall structure as I noticed that there is some clean up needed:
https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/wax-developer/pull/82
https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/wax-developer/pull/82

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
YES: PLEASE add an OIG calendar. This literally takes 3mins of your time:
- Create a public calendar subscription, that all guilds can subscribe to
- Add all the submission and appeal dates
- Add a monthly call with google meet link which is a voluntary call for all guilds, with predefined talking points (e.g. new guidelines etc.)
