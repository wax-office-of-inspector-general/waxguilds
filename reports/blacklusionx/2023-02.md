# Blacklusion February 2023 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
This month our producer setup failed unfortunately. The past year we only missed 8 rounds in total and in this instance we were 2h down unfortuantely. We have stayed unregged for a bit longer to not just fix the issues but to improve the overall setup. We have upgraded to leap 3.2 all of our servers that are connected to the Producers. Sentry nodes are 3.1 and the producers are 3.2 and 3.1. We have double checked the failover script and added keys to anchor mobile in order to potentially manually unreg via the phone. Our blocktime also as been drastically improved with the new Leap setup: from 0.28 to 0.16

Leap upgrade state:
- Producer is ready as written above
- The public facing api nodes will still report 2.1 though. But we are planning to update this before the upgrade to 3.2

### General Update
I have uploaded youtube video showing off some of the stuff we have been working on. Of course you will find the information also as written form here, for future reference, but I highly recommend watching the video as that will help to understand what we are up to in general

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
    - This month there has been an issue with newer hyperion versions, not passing the get_actions check as the timestamp field is valided incorrectly. As of writing this report I am still working on the patch for the hyperion timestamp issues and deploying some other changes that have been requested.
    - We are in active talks with some of the guilds and are working together with them to create checks that reflect a fair image of the tech
    - I would like mention that tokengamer reached out to us one week prior to the tech scores (on 18. Feb) complaining about their hyperion not being validated correctly. Detroit Ledger Tech also reached out to us after the tech scores, but mostly about some general questions. In general we want to encourage guilds to reach out to us directly, so I would like to make very clear in our report that these two guilds reached out this months and were doing their part in getting the validationcore correctly validating their infrastructure


### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
    - This month the main focus has been on the gaming platform. 
    - But the nice thing with component library, as teasered in the video, is that all changes can now be shared between projects. Meaning that even though we've been working on specific parts of the component libary we still have made advancements on the UI side of things of Blacklusion Cloud, as the codebases are essentially shared.


### Gaming Platform
- **Description: Steam for blockchains**
- Development Stage: Under development
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
    - The platform is in a beta state and can be used
    - We have been working on blockchain brawlers and Farming tales listing this month
    - We have been working on the redesign / refactoring to the new component library
    - In the video you can see how big of a difference the component library makes. But to sum it up, here are the main things that have majorly improved this month: 1. game browser, 2. nft browser, 3. game page, 4. game page. 5. added a wallet page
    - There are still some bugs some parts of the platform that need to be resolved. Additional stats need to be added as well. We are anticipating to launch by **march 22**. as this will be 3weeks prior to NFT NYC and give us some time to prepare some marketing for the conference

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Nothing we would get points for, but we attended NFT Paris a week ago, spreading the word about the WAX ecosystem

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
I created a PR translating another 5 big articles to german language:
https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/wax-developer/pull/97

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
YES: PLEASE add an OIG calendar. This takes 3mins of your time:
- Create a public calendar subscription, that all guilds can subscribe to
- Add all the submission and appeal dates
- Add a monthly call with google meet link which is a voluntary call for all guilds, with predefined talking points (e.g. new guidelines etc.)
