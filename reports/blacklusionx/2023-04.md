# Blacklusion February 2023 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
Smooth update to leap
We doubled the JVM Heap on the Hyperion cluster, by doubling the nodes total running. In general we experienced some abuse of our Hyperion cluster over the past months, but we'e been monitoring it closely and were usually able to resolve all issues quickly. If you have a look at our uptime stats it is a lot more stable now again

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### General Update
I have uploaded youtube video showing off some of the stuff we have been working on. Of course you will find the information also as written form here, for future reference, but I highly recommend watching the video as that will help to understand what we are up to in general

### Validationcore

- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
  - Together with the Leap update we were experiencing some issues with the p2p node validations. We've been doing some changes to that to ensure stability

### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
    - This month the main focus has been on the gaming platform. 
    - But the nice thing with component library, as teasered in the video, is that all changes can now be shared between projects. Meaning that even though we've been working on specific parts of the component library we still have made advancements on the UI side of things of Blacklusion Cloud, as the codebases are essentially shared.


### Gaming Platform
- **Description: Steam for blockchains**
- Development Stage: Public Beta (close to final)
- WAX Exclusive: Yes
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
    - The platform is fully operational
    - Blockchain Brawlers and Farming Tales listing completed
    - We redesigned the NFT cards to be less "opinionated" and more toned back
    - We redesigned the Filters
    - Used the NFT NYC to build good connections to ZOS and crittercraft and the WAX team, to ensure further listings of games and promotion resources once live
    - We were still struggling with the name, but on the conference we came up with the name illusive.gg If all things go as planned and we stick with that name we should officially release ASAP. Looking forward to finally get the platform out there

### Prometheus Exporter

- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Link: - https://t.me/WaxPagerBot 
- **News / Updates**:
  - Guilds are using the Blacklusion Pager. e.g. a guild was complaining about us being responsible for them loosing points (which was due the validationcore correctly recognizing issues with elastic and classifying the endpoint as down). The pager allows us to offer these guilds realtime updates to be aware of any potential issues
