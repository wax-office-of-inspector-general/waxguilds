### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No

    - Some general maintenance, but otherwise all focus on the launch of illusive.gg this month

### OneApi

- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
    - This month a lot of stuff has happend together with the illusive console. Over there we implemented a lot of new user flows, in regards of creating projects and then letting the user create games in these projects. These user flows are transferable to OneApi, as its all the same database / component library.
    - I really hope to write in the next submission, that we released the new version of blacklusion cloud. We need to do a refactoring of the main backend, as the current one is way slower than I'd like
    - Once thats done, adding the remaining blacklusion cloud flows should be rather quick

    - After the launch 10 days ago we already have shipped two updates + a couple of minor fixes (1. new stats: we are showing the owner distribution for the nfts, 2. Its easier to access apps on mobile, through our operating system detection)
    - We have a bunch of more features planned, that really should improve the usecase of the platform. We are currently actively working on: User login & inventory, Community page for every game with live feed across Twitter, Youtube & medium. Downloadable Client, that can be used to distribute game clients
    - After the launch we have started the conversations with multiple games and grants. Nothing that is final enough to talk about quite yet, but more integration work happening soon
