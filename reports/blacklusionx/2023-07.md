- We upgraded everything to the hotfix
- There has been an issue with Hyperion. I have spent all Friday "trying to fix it". I've upgraded Hyperion to the latest version. I've used the newly released repair tool. I've also tried manually inputting ranges and reindexing as we would do it in the old days, based on kibana. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. For me the inconsistency is the issue. As I wouldn't mind spending a couple of days fixing something if I know it is actually fixed. But after restarting the indexer about 100 times and every time deleting the rabbitmq queues I decided to focus on more important things. I've reindexed the same ranges (with and without the repair tool) multiple times. We were only able to recover about 5000 blocks. For the other blocks, I have zero clue what the issue might be, because again sometimes it did work properly. So the settings seem to work. At this point, I don't see much we can do about it, other than spinning up a new cluster. It seems like other guilds successfully host hyperion (although while I was doing our taxes I discovered about 3 guilds that had missing data (but claim to have full history), so not even sure if we are the problem here), but at this point, I am just really frustrated of spending so much time and not even getting proper log outputs. We are seriously considering shutting down our Hyperion. Out of all APIs we are running, hyperion is by far the service that creates the most issues. Compared to the type of usage we are getting, mostly alien worlds bots, I am not sure if this is worth spending time and money on or if the same resources would be better spent somewhere else. Personally, I feel like the initial concept was outgrown by real-world usage. Hosting on testnet is not an issue at all. But for WAX mainnet it just keeps breaking. Also, you can take down a whole cluster with just a single request, if you know how. Nothing I would consider "production ready".
- If you look at our apis, the "get-currency-balance" check is failing from time-to-time at least on the validationcore. We are investigating this. We have received a report from one other guild after the hotfix, that they were having similar timeout issues. So hang in with us, it is definitely something we are aware and we've been spending hours investigating. We hope to have it fixed by next week, we will probably order some new servers to do some A/B testing and check if this is due to nodeos (as we saw some first minor issues with the initial leap upgrade) or if this is due to our configuration. We have consulted with other guilds and can provide proof if required.
- Usage Statistics. To measure the statistics we have our own elasticsearch cluster scraping the logs. It seems like the atomicassets stats are not properly reported. This could be because we scrape the logs from our proxy at wax.blacklusion.io, which also supports atomic requests but the endpoint aa.wax.blacklusion.io bypasses the proxy. We will look into this until the next valuation
    Over the last 4 weeks:
    - v1/chain: 62,081,782
    - v1/history: 78,613
    - v2/history: 7,710,018
    - atomic: 17,835
    - total: 70,273,732
    By far the most popular is call is /v1/chain/get_table_rows. Most requests originate from the Tailand region. Close after is Europe

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
    - Added some small changes to support the hotfix
    - I am personally really annoyed at how slow the query performance of the validationcore is from times to times. I will have a look into this, once we released blacklusion cloud, so hopefully until the next submission there should be some progress
    - I had a conversation with Josep about adding IPFS to the validationcore. For transparency I will add the TLDR here: Even though I do support the idea of adding IPFS, I still have my doubts. If we add IPFS I would like to add it correctly. At the end of the day, we would like to provide a helpful tool not only for the IGs but also for the community. We want that a random person not familiar with WAX can build a product and get started easily by finding quality endpoints with the validationcore. If we just check if the IPFS is present in the bp.json, it would be a bit misleading, as that IPFS endpoint might not pin all necessary data. If the IPFS gateway is not used that much, it usually has pretty bad peering in our experience, meaning that it technically works, but requesting non-pinned files would probably timeout. So before we go ahead and build checks, I would prefer if we can reach a consensus on which files would need to be pinned (e.g. all WAX collections).

### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
    - As a quick recap, we built an off-chain account system that is used to create games on illusive.gg and manage API endpoints in blacklusion cloud. So essentially our old backend was based on a document-based database. The flexibility sounded good at first but lead to a horrible performance. So before moving ahead, we wanted to make sure to actually use the correct technologies. We switched to a Postgres abstraction. This month meant rebuilding all the previous functionality in postgres. This has massively improved performance (in some cases ~80x). Additionally, it has improved the overall data structure and has allowed us to add a bunch of features that were missing. With the new backend, we have added the functionality including the UI to transfer & delete teams as well as assets.
    - I really wanted to get this out before this submission. But some parts of the database migration were more complex than initially anticipated. We have already created a new repository for the blacklusion cloud console that is tailor made for this product and shares a lot of UI with the illusive Console.
    - We really want to get this out asap, as we got a lot of interest from the games we have been working with. As the database migration is about 80% complete, I expect it to take about ~2 weeks until we can roll it out to the first customers. We will start by migrating our existing users of the still-running closed beta bases on the old backend. Then we will get some of the games on there. Once successful, we will create a landing page and open it to the public.
    


### Gaming Platform
- **Description: Steam for blockchains**
- Development Stage: Released ðŸ¥³
- Link: https://illusive.gg
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
    - Last submission we released https://illusive.gg
    - Compared to the last submission we increased our Twitter followers from ~200 to ~920
    - We have worked with multiple games together to create giveaways and promote their games
    - We deployed our inventory update, allowing users to connect their wallets and look at their NFTs. The inventory is filtered to show "only gaming assets", but allows the user to also show art and other NFTs. All the sign-in flow is custom coded and much easier to understand for users that are not familiar with blockchain. Also it is completely responsive for mobile
    - We made a couple of changes to the UI (minor changes of the hero sections, tabs etc.)
    - Our embedded social feed is also working locally. Not deployed yet, because of the changes to Twitter's apis this month. Expect this to launch soon
    - Once we launch Blacklusion Cloud we should hopefully be able to dedicate 100% of the dev time to illusive. Since the initial release, we have been talking to a lot of users and games with the mission to understand the current pains. Through this we have decided to shift illusive.gg to a more social direction. It will most likely be a Web2 / Web3 hybrid (taking our learnings from the blacklusion cloud account system) and building an off-chain login, to appeal more to traditional gamers. Then a user can connect their wallet to access their NFTs. This is especially important as we are planning our true crosschain expansion. Another thing we would like to push with this is the user-generated content. It won't be like instagram / tiktok, but instead more information-based. Users can create strategy guides on games and add community resources. E.g. add discord servers, community tools (e.g. Alien Worlds ROI calculators etc.). Then there will be an upvote system in place that prevents users from just adding random resources. We imagine building out a "community hub" for every game, where the users can find everything they would need, from the start (first introduction, browse NFTs) all to advanced use cases such as community tools, content, additional discords etc.
    - Another thing we are looking to integrate are game wikis, eliminating the need to write comprehensive whitepapers. Instead, games could offer a pool of in-game tokens, and in-game NFTs to every member that writes content for their game wiki. Since we already have a full-fledged NFT integration, we would then link every wiki page to the NFTs, e.g. community creates page for every NFT template -> if you look at an NFT on our page it will show an explanation of what this NFT is used for in the game etc. Ideally, every game wiki would be moderated by a mini DAO (game devs, members of the game's community etc.). At this point it is not entirely clear how it will be exactly in the end, we'd like to have the content open source, so it could be e.g. directly into the games. We have already pitched this idea to multiple games with huge interest. We will likely roll out a bad MVP over the next weeks and check the resonance. If successful, we will build a proper solution.
    - We have received a couple of requests about "private analytics": Average value per customer, new users, what other games the user play etc. We are seriously considering building this out. This will be a subscription-based product. Either super cheap or the pricing will scale based on the nft volume of the game, to ensure all games can afford it even with current market conditions.
    - We are still in talks about possible grants. We are making progress, but nothing I can share publicly yet
