# Blacklusion July 2023 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
We fixed our Hyperion Cluster. I also sent Rakeden a video per DM that shows our Kibana and verifies that the blocks are actually there. This means our Hyperion cluster is back to normal with full block history.
We noticed some issues with our Delphi oracle script. The issue was actually the Bittrex api as they stopped serving the WAXP-ETH pair. We have adjusted our script and are now using a different source. Everything back to normal.
We have our own elasticsearch cluster scraping the logs. It seems like the atomicassets stats are not properly reported. This could be because we scrape the logs from our proxy at wax.blacklusion.io, which also supports atomic requests but the endpoint aa.wax.blacklusion.io bypasses the proxy. We will look into this until the next valuation
    Over the last 4 weeks:
    - v1/chain: 98,460,000
    - v1/history: 77,230
    - v2/history: 3,170,000
    - atomic: 29,780
    - total: 102,260,000
    (up 1.4x since the last submission)
    By far the most popular is call is /v1/chain/get_table_rows. Most requests originate from the Tailand region. Close after is Europe

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
    - We really wanted to deploy some changes this month. But this month we fully focused on Blacklusion Cloud, as we believe this will add more to the ecosystem, but hang in tight we are still planning some changes for the validationcore and we will most likely add them next month.

### OneApi
- **Description: Load balancer for guild endpoints based on the geographical location and function of the endpoints**
- Link: https://oneapi.dev
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:  
    - We built a custom authentication gateway. It syncs in realtime with our database in the cloud and caches the keys locally using redis. There are some fallbacks built in as well, to ensure the changes take effect immediately and the user has close to no delay. The auth gateway is built in a way to ensure the keys are not leaked as cleartext
    - We advanced our Stripe integration. Last month Credit Cards and the Billing Address were working. This month we have added the UI and methods to create and cancel subscriptions but we also added additional logic to sync the database with stripe in realtime. This took a lot longer than initially anticipated. As a final result we have now a flexible system that not only allows to handle api subscriptions but as this is tied to our other products as well, users will be able to create subscriptions e.g. on illusive GG with their same accounts
    - We have revisted the API Key creation to ensure the API Keys are secure and the user can regenerate them anytime
    - We have decided to move the api key from the header to the url itself. So e.g. https://rpc.wax.blacklusion.cloud/fTspFB_ylqgTCF9cvmrfLhH89dN2jrr1OdQ/v1/chain/get_info. This allows to use our premium endpoints in any script / scenario without any further changes
    - We have added logic that allows authenticated users to query our elastic cluster to get exact usage stats on the apis. Currently the user can show the total number of requests but also the total number of invalid requests (requests returning invalid http codes). The elasticcluster holds a lot more data (e.g. geo location, exact logs etc.) than could be used in the future
    - It is currently in the final testing stage. We have some interest from some of the projects on illusive GG. Feel free to DM us @blacklusion to get a demo


### Gaming Platform
- **Description: Steam for blockchains**
- Development Stage: Released ðŸ¥³
- Link: https://illusive.gg
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
    - We have made a couple of changes to how IPFS images are handled and cached to ensure faster loading times
    - We have started the transition to a more social platform. Our first step will be to allow users to create content. For this we are building a "notion-style" editor that allows to user markdown / commands inline to create medium-style posts. This means you could create get-started / strategy guides for game.
    - A second project we are working on is the addition of "private" stats. This will be an additional subscription service behind a paywall for projects owners to understand the metrics of their game and how it compares to the other projects on the platform
    - We have kicked off the development of the 3D Museum / Wallet viewer. This is a WAX Labs project, but once completed will also be integrated into the illusive GG platform: https://labs.wax.io/proposals/147
    
### Prometheus Exporter
- **Description: Expose metrics to Prometheus for monitoring purposes for chain, atomic and Hyperion nodes**
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/eosio-prometheus-exporter
- **News / Updates**:  
    - Other guilds are using our exporters

### Blacklusion Pager
- **Description: Push notifications from the validationcore**
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Link: - https://t.me/WaxPagerBot 
- **News / Updates**:
    - No updates

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
    - Since the launch of illusive GG, we've been in close contact with Novopangea (Mike Creati). We have offered our knowledge and connections in regards to game development in order to get a new project rolling. I am not entirely sure how much we can mention in this report already publicly, but we can provide further proof of conversations if required.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
    - Since the launch of illusive GG we have been in talks with Alien Worlds about an more detailed integration of the Alien Worlds Metaverse. This month we have signed the contracts and are "officially" ahead (should be announced in the upcoming days).
    

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
