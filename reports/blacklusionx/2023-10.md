# Blacklusion October 2023 Update

## What is the name of your Guild?

**Blacklusion**

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
This month our infrastructure was more unstable than we would have liked. Due to ongoing issues with Hyperion, we have decided to take this API down, as we believe the resources & time previously dedicated to Hyperion are better spent elsewhere. Our setup consisted of 3 elasticnodes + ship node. Just adding these three servers as additional API / sentry nodes would greatly improve our bandwidth. Our Atomic API was also experiencing some issues this month, however, we do plan to keep offering this service, hence we have ordered new servers and switched operations to the new servers. Since then the Uptime has been at 100% again. We also had some issues with our Producer, although we have deployed some temporary fixes, we are planning on some bigger changes in the upcoming weeks, as we shuffle servers around and increase capacity and other aspects of our infrastructure setup.

Over the last 4 weeks:
    - v1/chain: 35,000,000
    - atomic: 750,000 (with our Atomic Api Upgrades we have switched the subdomain aa.wax.blacklusion.io to our main proxy for accurate measuring. This was about a week ago, so we should have accurate measurings next report)
    - total: 35,750,000

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### Validationcore
- **Description: Statistics and Validations for guild infrastructures**
- Link: https://wax.validationcore.io/
- Development Stage: Released
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: Yes
- Code Repo: https://github.com/Blacklusion/validationcore
- **News / Updates**:
    - We have changed the calculation of the guilds materialized view. Previously this view was blocking some of the overview requests as this was not calculated concurrently and recalculating this view could take 10mins+. With the changed code this view is calculated concurrently and improves performance, as the other requests are not blocked during calculation anymore.
    - We still believe performance could be improved even further though. We track data since November 2021. We are currently considering only storing data up to one year in the active database, as the data of the previous ~3months is probably the most important data. Reducing the retention timeframe would not only improve the performance but also the user experience, as the sliders for "all time", would not query 2 years of data, but instead only show the previous year, which in most instances will be the most impacting data on a guild.

### Gaming Platform
- **Description: Steam for blockchains**
- Development Stage: Released ðŸ¥³
- Link: https://illusive.gg
- WAX Exclusive: No
- Open Source: No
- Code Repo: N/A
- **News / Updates**:
    - We have made huge progress on our social platform features this month. We have developed:
        - Off-chain Web2 account system, that allows to claim a username. This is important, as we are planning to roll out other chains (Polygon & IMX), for this, we would like to have an account system that spans across chains. Also, we are working towards integrating non-web3 games to target a bigger market
        - Built out new UI for the user profiles and ways for users to upload profiles and cover images
        - Integration of our notion-style content editor
        - Feed pages that allow filtering content/guides based on a game
        - Content pages, that will display a reader for user-generated content. The user-generated content will go live soon and it will build the basis for our AI features.
    - Until this goes live we have the following changes to be made:
        - Wallet connection between Web2 and Web3 accounts
        - User authentication settings (password reset etc.)
        - Some minor bug fixes
    - We have announced our grant of gHubs. The Alien Worlds integration should go live end of this month. https://alienworlds.io/blogs/galactic-hubs-season-2-update/
    - We have developed a new, more engaging Hero. It now plays a video in the background.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
- We already submitted this last month and I honestly missed it didn't get credited. I would like to have more insights, why this is not credited, compared to other contributions. I am happy to provide screenshots to prove our communication and involvement.
- Since the launch of illusive GG, we've been in close contact with Novopangea (Mike Creati). We have offered our knowledge and connections in regards to game development in order to get a new project rolling. I am not entirely sure how much we can mention in this report already publicly, but we can provide further proof of conversations if required.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
    

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
