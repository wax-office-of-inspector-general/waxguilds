## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We have restored our Hyperion service as well as the Atomic API service we run.
Hyperion was restored first during the guild evaluation for the month of June.
The Atomic API service took a little more effort and was restored and fully indexed slightly after the June evaluation.
We are continuing to monitor and improve our infrastructure and reorganize it slightly for improved performance, reliability, and service.
