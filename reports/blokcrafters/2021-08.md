## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Our Atomic API service is up and running fine this month.
We are performing a hardware refresh of nearly all of our servers. This is an ongoing project started about August 14th.
We are requisitioning new peer servers, Hyperion servers, and several others. We feel this will quadruple the service availability,
performance, and reliability of WAX services provided by BlokCrafters.
In the midst of this happening, one of our existing elasticsearch servers is now experiencing
hardware problems with the memory. Another new replacement machine has been ordered.
