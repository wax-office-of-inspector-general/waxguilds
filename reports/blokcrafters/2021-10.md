This month we got our Hyperion service running on Testnet once again and it is now also up to date.
Plans for the coming month include getting Atomic API running for Testnet, upgrading nodeos everywhere
to nodeos v2.0.13 (this has already started), and continuing to work on the projects that we
have in development.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
Just a one-time repeat from last month:

We would like to ask the OIG to consider awarding points to guilds for providing critical services for Testnet. Especially in the area of the APIs necessary for a functioning blockchain - History (V1, Hyperion, Atomic). We understand that due to the nature of testnet being for testing that awarding points for reliable block production would be counter-intuitive.
