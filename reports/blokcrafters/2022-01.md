## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
This month we spent time making sure all servers running nodeos had adequate memory and swap space.
In addition all servers with the wax blockchain software were upgraded to version v2.0.13wax01.
We added one more backup block producer node in the USA and have another server waiting installation
in Finland.  We installed another server for Atomic API in Europe and it is working to catch up
with the blockchain by indexing from block 1.  This is taking an extraordinary amount of time.
We switched our load balancer from using nginx to haproxy.
