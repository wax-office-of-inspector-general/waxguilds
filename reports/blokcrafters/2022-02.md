## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

It has been an active 6 weeks at BlokCrafters for TechOps.  The Atomic API server we installed in Finland
last review is now fully functional.  This period we also installed a new SHIP server in Europe.
We are in the midst of installing a new cluster of servers for Hyperion in Europe - this just finished the
ABI scan portion of setup and is now starting to re-index the chain.  We are also still planning to
install an Atomic API server for testnet - this work was preempted by the Hyperion setup.

- Product Description: This product is an easy one stop shop for navigating the entire WAX ecosystem. We are updating the website weekly with new information/links to assist any WAX user to find their way around WAX.
+ For our forward looking roadmap for waxdapps: We will be creating public api’s accessible by the community for our ever-growing database of all things wax. Api’s will be broken down by category i.e. (Developer tools, Play to earn games etc). Following those additions we plan to integrate volume metrics based on popularity, new, featured, and more per selections per categories.
+ Mynifties IOS app is still in Review with Apple and we are in the meantime preparing an android version. We will have Mynifties as a released product in the next IG report.
