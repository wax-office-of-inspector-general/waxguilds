## What is the name of your Guild?
BlokCrafters

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
Lots happened in the world of TechOps for BlokCrafters this past period.  We moved our Hyperion API
to different servers which was the bulk of our work for TechOps.  These are on servers with more memory
and disk and just generally now are able to handle the crushing load we see with the History API.  As part of this
process we also created a utility that will easily fill gaps in the Hyperion Block history in ElasticSearch.
This little piece is still a work in progress and needs to be integrated back into EOSRio's main Hyperion github.
We also finally did get time to setup an Atomic API server for WAX Testnet.  This has been running along nicely.
