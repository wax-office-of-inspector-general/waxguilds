- Android App:
upcoming version of Android will include the following:
1. Integration with Crash Analytic
2. Improvement to account overView landing View
3. Android Account overview View will have the same summary view (like iOS version) - summary View will be Anchored at the top of the view for Android.
4. Our app works well for Google Pixel 4 & Pixel 6 devices as well as Samsung devices which is over 50% of the market devices - but it does crash on some Android models. The crash issue will be resolved, and we are doing end-to-end / unit testing in the upcoming Android release will include the fix for crash.
- Over this next rating period will stand as equals with the competition. (Tokenhead, Tokengamer) You can keep up to date with our next MyNifties Release via our Twitter: https://twitter.com/mynifties

+ NFT Origins is finished with building out 1000Mermaids Series 1 collection but we have decided to push back the release of this collection to better time market sentiment. We are also in the works on finishing the build of series 1.5 of Tangible NFTs. We will give you more drop details when we get closer to the release dates of both! 

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

Not at this time - things are going well.
