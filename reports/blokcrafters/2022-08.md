## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

This past month was spent investigating what systems needed to be refreshed and/or replaced.
Several peer nodes were replaced and this project is also ongoing.
We are also curious about the problems with transactions not making it to the chain - delphi feeds.
We are doing our best to investigate this issue and will continue assisting in the efforts as best
as we can.
