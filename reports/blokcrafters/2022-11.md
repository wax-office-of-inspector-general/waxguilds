## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We are spending time addressing the embarrassing loss of performance for the WAX Testnet
we experienced this past month.  That should not have happened.  However - we are adding
more monitoring to our systems to help make sure that this does not happen again.
We have updated to version 3.1.0wax01-rc3 for our testnet producers.
