## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We successfully installed wax-leap 3.1.2wax01 software for WAX Testnet this past month with
all services being returned to operational status.  We are working on planning for when WAX Mainnet
is also switched to wax-leap to attempt to avoid some of the outage time we experienced with Testnet.
