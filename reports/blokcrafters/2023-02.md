## What is the name of your Guild?

BlokCrafters

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

#### WAX Blockchain Upgrade Information
We have begun changing nodes to wax-leap version 3.2.0wax01 - all API nodes except block producer nodes are now running this version.
The BP nodes will be switched over to the new version at the chosen time when all guilds do this.  We're watching the telegram channels
and waiting for the word on when this will happen.

#### Technical Operations Update
We'be been working to upgrade our remaining Ubuntu 18.04 based servers to 20.04.  This work is almost complete.
An updated SHIP node is in the process of syncing to the blockchain.  This node has more disk available than the current
SHIP nodes.
We have also been working on and supporting the new BlockchainMon project.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?
+ New Product release: BlockchainMon io
## BlockchainMon
- https://blockchainmon.io/
- BlockchainMon tracks all guilds infrastructure hourly, the checks we are watching are similar to eosnations producer scorecard; Reg Producer, Organization, Block Production, API Endpoints, P2P Endpoints, bp.json On-Chain, History, Hyperion, Dfuse, Firehose, Atomic Assets, Account, Chain.json. Each guild can receive one point per succesful check of the 13 checks done every hour. A guild can receive a maximum of 312 points per day & 2184 points per week. The guilds points are tracked via a bar graph and at the end each day the highest scoring guild or guilds (ties are possible) will receieve a gold badge. The second highest guild or guilds will receieve a silver badge and last but not least the third highest scoring guilds will receive a bronze badge. If you are not within the top three highest scoring of any given day you will receive no badge. Our intention for BlockchainMon is to increase awareness among guilds and community while rewarding guilds who are supporting WAX with important infrastructure.
- For our forward looking objectives for BlockchainMon.io: Currently the reward system of badges is not implemented yet but we would like to request that the office of inspector general to work with us on this, we would like to use the OIG WAX NFT collection to create the Gold, silver & Bronze NFT badges. We believe that BlockchainMons reward system is aligned with what the OIG stands for, increasing awareness to guilds performance and rewarding guilds who perform well (gold, silver & bronze NFT badges).

- For our forward looking objectives for WAXDAPPS: We will be fine combing our website when the Cloud wallet updates to the new version. Any projects that are not using the newest version of the WAX cloud Wallet JS library will be removed after 10 days post upgrade.

We have been getting less traction lately on youtube and decided that since majority of the crypto community is on Twitter that we will transform the way we create and deliver our content. Since twitter now enabled long form video publishing we will post most of our content in video format & article format on twtitter, we will still continue to publish content on youtube but we are going to increase our twitter content while decreasing our youtube content. This month we had some extremely good traction on some of our content where we recieved 5,000+ views and many of the community members are engaging with us.

Twitter video "WAX wallet major update walk through" in this video we went over the new WAX cloud wallet & also notified developers to update WAX JS library.
