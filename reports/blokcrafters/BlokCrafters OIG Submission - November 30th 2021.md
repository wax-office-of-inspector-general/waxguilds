## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
+ Our NFT studio NFTOrigins has successfully launched TangibleNFTs.io series 1 vIRL nfts on WAX. You can take a look at the collections market details on waxmarketcap https://waxmarketcap.com/collection/tangiblenfts, also please take a look at the project itself for ecosystem impact. I believe this collection is unique in the way we are utilizing blending and vIRLs. We are also currently working on Series 2 for TangibleNFTs and are excited to bring it to the WAX community. The type of vIRL nfts we are creating are unlike any other on WAX atm.
