**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

Our Hyperion service has been renovated and should work much better going forward. Our AtomicAssets API service is running and indexing is still on-going. Currently we are running as a standby guild - and we are doing very well with reliability on WAX Testnet.

## May 2021

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

Nothing particularly new this month.  We are hoping to have tripled our Hyperion service capacity before the scores are finalized and released.  We are still working on setting up an Atomic API service as well.

We did place another BP node into service which is performing very very well benchmark wise for us (1st or 2nd speed wise among all the WAX guilds).  And so far, due to good peering - we have been doing very well in the reliability benchmark also.  We continue to try and achieve 0 missed blocks (not rounds) for the month.

WAXMon is still under development and we are aiming at an initial release soon, hopefully for next month (March) now.  It is not a dead project, but is taking an inordinate amount of time.

## July 2020

**What is the name of our Guild?**

- BlokCrafters

**Does your guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations criteria?**

A couple changes were made this past month:

- We added a node to push datapoints to the DelphiOracle service and are now doing this around the clock.
- We also added a peer node to participate in the WAX Internal Peer list as maintained within Keybase. We are now one of two guilds (along with EOSAmsterdam) who are doing this. We peer with the nodes in this list and they can peer with our node as well. The names on this list are only available to participants in the Keybase group for WAX Guilds.

## June 2020

Hello Inspector Generals,

Here is our Guild Submission for this months IG report

**What is the name of our Guild?**

1. BlokCrafters

**Does your guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations criteria?**

We are now running wax v2.0.6wax02 on all of our nodes with the sole exception of our block producer for mainnet. That is still running wax 1.8.4 and we are hoping to see wax mainnet move to wax 2.0 as soon as feasible. We also have Hyperion v3.0 running for both mainnet and testnet. Also - we are now showing 100% round availability for mainnet. This was an exciting milestone to reach for our team! The improved peering setup we invested in is paying off for us and the entire WAX team. With a recent missed round on testnet, we have fallen to just over 99.99% round availability for testnet. We hope to recapture 100% for next month. We are also planning to implement the delphi oracle service for next month - we do not currently have this so were a bit relieved to discover that points for it will not be rewarded until next month. I believe we meet all technical operations criteria this month. A first time for us!

## May 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

1. We continue to work towards 99.99% round availability on mainnet. We installed another producer node where we are running wax 2.0 for testnet. And we're looking forward to helping us all move to wax 2.0 on mainnet as well.

2. We upgraded to wax 2.0 on testnet as soon as we could - Michael's medium post helped with this.

Other than that - we continue to improve our peering. A new full node was added recently and we're actively working to bring that into the mix.

## March 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

There were no major changes for the last month. We are continuing to improve our underlying infrastructure by adding new nodes for improved performance and node peering redundancy. Assuming we miss no more rounds on Mainnet, we expect that next month we will reach a 99.98% round availability metric.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

1. Our first Tool developed is a WAX guild map that shows the infrastructure of all guilds on the WAX blockchain. Tool can be found here [https://blokcrafters.com/map-tool/map-tool.php](https://blokcrafters.com/map-tool/map-tool.php)

Our MAU data is gathered via AWStats data analytics we have running on our website to check unique users using our tool.

if you have further questions about the MAU please don't hesitate to contact us.

2. We have a WAX Blockchain monitoring and alert tool in development. The information about the problem that it solves, description of the product, roadmap & team members actively working on it can be found at [https://github.com/blokcrafters/public-projects/blob/master/waxmon.md](https://github.com/blokcrafters/public-projects/blob/master/waxmon.md) This is very likely to be a longer term and ongoing project. We are considering applying to the newly announced Worker Proposal System from WAX Labs for help with it.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Business Development?**

1. We have partnered with a local coffee shop [http://basimocafe.com/](http://basimocafe.com/) business to promote WAX account creation to there customers by incentivizing them to create WAX all access accounts in exchange for a Free cup of coffee. The exact steps a customer goes through is highlighted below ([https://www.instagram.com/p/B9t_NR7J2ah/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9t_NR7J2ah/))

1. On-site advertisement in the front and the back of the business

the customers either come from socials FB/Instagram ad or local foot traffic ad by the front & back of the business and sees free coffee if they create a WAX all access account.

2. after creating account now at at the register to Redeem there free cup of coffee they scan code

once they have scanned the code it will bring them to our website where they "redeem"[https://blokcrafters.com/redeem.html](https://blokcrafters.com/redeem.html)

3. At Register customer emails us their account name of there wax account confirming the transaction of account creation.

Then they are handed their free cup of Coffee and a Brochure with information about WAX and they can instantly start playing games from there phone using the WAX account they just created. They can also join the WAX telegram if they want to join the community. : )

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

1. We are collaborating with a local virtual reality gaming business [https://www.simcentertampabay.com/](https://www.simcentertampabay.com/) to promote WAX to there customers and plan on CO-hosting future meetups inside there facility to take advantage of there resources.

We have been working on & released our first version of a tool that is a map of the WAX network. Its shows the Node information (Producer, Seed, Full, Hyperion) & locations of all guilds Top 21 & Standby on a map, letting the average WAX user see how diverse the WAX network is when taking into consideration there vote. https://blokcrafters.com/map-tool/map-tool.php

eW have published the code used to generate the map location information from the block chain on our Github. We are using the MIT License so this is freely available for the WAX community.

# Pre-Evaluation Form Responses

### Please provide some information regarding when and how your Guild got involved with the EOSIO or WAX ecosystem. Links to resources are helpful.

We started with Bitshares in 2017. We were mostly speculators at the time & interested in governance and how one would participate more then just investing. We have been in the EOSIO ecosystem since the EOS ico launch, we have been following the development of eos and always wanted to participate in some form but felt the barrier to entry was high for our experience at the time because we were still learning software development. Once we heard of WAX it was like a fresh start not only is WAX right down our alley as passionate gamers but also because the chain is in its infancy and right now we have a chance to make an impact & make a name for ourself early on. Like all the genesis block producers for EOS that have made names for there self.

### Has anyone in the Guild previously produced blocks on an EOSIO or DPOS network in the past? If so, which ones and what nodes did they help operate?

No

### Please provide information regarding projects that your Guild is working on to improve the WAX ecosystem. Information about plans, progress, and timelines is helpful. This includes projects that have been submitted for the WAX Guild Showcase program.

We have yet to begin working on a project to improve the WAX ecosystem. We have just finished setting up our infrastructure to meet the core requirements & are looking into adding Hyperion history node. As for what we want to build we have a couple ideas, and once they are developed further we will be sharing it.

### Please state the jurisdiction your Guild is domiciled in, as well as the jurisdiction that your Guild's nodes are deployed in.

Clearwater Florida is where the Guild is registered in as a LLC. Our Nodes are located two in Texas & one in Kansas.

### Please share any usage metrics you have, if any. This includes data specific to applications and user activity driven to the WAX ecosystem as a result of your Guild's efforts.

N/A

### If possible, please share information about businesses that your Guild is engaging with that are seeking to learn about and leverage the WAX ecosystem in some way.

Do not have any at the moment but we are planning on looking into how we can help inform small time gaming studios to learn about WAX. In telegram it seemed that a couple people were interested in pitch decks, but i see its on the guilds them-selfs to learn about WAX and make our own pitches using the resources that are already out there. Which there is plenty.

### Please share any information regarding community building efforts championed by your Guild. This can be facilitating translation of documentation, organizing meetups, and otherwise driving social and human engagement within the platform.

As I said we have just finished meeting the core requirements and by the next OIG report I think we will have more to show for these sections.

### Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

None at the moment. As we participate in more reports I am sure we will have more feedback.
