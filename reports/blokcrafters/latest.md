### Description:
*WAX AI provides tailored assistance to members of the WAX ecosystem, enhancing their experience and productivity by leveraging Openai Assistant API. WAX AI is trained on various forms of data scraped from WAX ecosystem resources. it can deliver relevant and precise support.
WAX AI MVP is able to assist a user just like a normal LLM would be able to but it can deliver more precise support compared to a normal LLM due to its added training, It can also query realtime data on chain. We plan to expand its abilities & features but are happy to announce its initial release! If you have any feedback after using it, we would love to hear it as we continue to build waxai.io!*
