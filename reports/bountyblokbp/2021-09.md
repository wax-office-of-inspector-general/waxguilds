## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Continuing to support/maintain bountyblok.io, distribution drop tool, and GIFT NFT. 

Drop tool:
Several enhancements and bug fixes. Added the ability to support multiple twitter accounts so that you can fetch accounts from specific tweet of an account you don’t necessarily have oauth access. For example Marty needed to fetch Funko’s twitter’s promo tweet comments.  
Added the ability to filter out certain tweet/comments that contain suspicious keywords that many bots use. 

New: Working on a contest creator tool for bountyblok.io - think Gleam with NFTs.

We're moderators on the WAX discord, and run a WAX specific telegram group for NFT projects @bountybloknft almost 300 Members who represent a project. We have support staff on there helping 7 days a week. We hired a new person to handle the email requests as this seems to keep growing.

Our team got involved with Corvin’s team to help QA the new upcoming game on WAX: https://dev.liquiduniverse.io/
