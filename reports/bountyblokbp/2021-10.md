Continuing to support/maintain bountyblok.io, distribution drop tool, and GIFT NFT. 

Drop tool:
Several enhancements and bug fixes.

New LOOK AND FEEL going live soon but you can still see it here: https://wax.drop.bountyblok.io/

Made changes to our discord bots / backend to make it easier to drop it in new discord channels. The latest one will be https://discord.com/invite/epicshit Travis Wright's new discord channel.

Implemented a drop on-demand backend service that larger projects needed and will be using in-game such as hodlgod.com and https://niftyville.net/

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We're moderators on the WAX discord, and run a WAX specific telegram group for NFT projects @bountybloknft almost 300 Members who represent a project. We have support staff on there helping 7 days a week. 

Over 2 dozens projects have been whitelisted to access bountyblok tools to distribute their NFTs and engage their following since late September and all of October. 

We have met and are collaborating with the Niftyville.net Lead game devs to implement custom solutions for them to be able to easily reward gamers with rewards in-game. 

Currently working with Marty from the WAX team to help launch the upcoming Twitter promotional campaign for Hot Wheels and Miss Universe.

We run multiple NFT bots that engage users with rewards on multiple WAX discords including BCHeroes and Onessus and currently adding Travis' Epic Sh*t Show.
 
We're currently discussing with Adam from YoshiDrop for potential membership drop mechanisms.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

No
