### wax.drop.bountyblok.io

New LOOK AND FEEL is now LIVE and you can see it here: https://wax.drop.bountyblok.io/. We have migrated the majority of the projects over to that new tool. We also added new features to the Twitter component that allows you to reward and mint on demand NFTs to wallets who participated in the competition on a specific HASHTAG.

We are also working on an Enterprise version of the distribution tool where we opensource a lean backend for you to host, and the existing distribution tool front end talks to this backend allowing MASS DISTRIBUTION in the hundreds of thousands. We understand this is only needed for a few very large projects but we anticipate the demand to grow in 2022 as well.

There have been over 13,000 Distributions (from a few hundred to several thousands of accounts per distribution).

### wax.giftnft.io

We added a few features for influencers/promoters which essentially allows you to share a giftnft url for users to claim, across different influencer channels. This was a request by the WAX team for their hot wheels campaign.

There have been 25K NFTs gifted in 2021 by Email and Twitter DMs across 744 Collections.

We have been in several communications with Rob and Warwick from novopangea.io for over a year now as they have been looking for a home for their project. We recommended WAX for this project, and recently launched their NFT promotional campaigns a few of weeks ago.

We also connected the Token expert from animocabrands to help launch their upcoming WAX / EOSIO Token
