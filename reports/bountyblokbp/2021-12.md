## What is the name of your Guild?

bountyblokbp

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We purchased new servers to scale out the atomicassets API. In short, we are going to setup "read replica" to postgres and replicate the DB to other servers for scalability in the next 2 weeks.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Continuing to support/maintain the wax.bountyblok.io APIs/Portal, the distribution drop tool, and GIFT NFT. 


### 1) wax.bountyblok.io

Status: RELEASED

wax.bountyblok.io 's APIs and portal are now used by the Largest Trading Simulators in the United States.

https://www.stocktrak.com

https://www.howthemarketworks.com

https://www.personalfinancelab.com

https://www.wallstreetsurvivor.com

https://virtualstockmarket.tdbank.com

https://californiasms.com

https://www.virtual-stock-exchange.com


The API made approx 187,690 TX calls to our endpoint in the last 30 days (it's quieter during the holidays as schools and banks are mostly closed/holiday). 

NEW FEATURE: We now have dedicated secure API that niftyville, hodlgod and a few other projects have been using in the last 2 weeks or so allowing them to easily mint on demand within the game engine. 

WHAT'S NEXT: gleam type contests - complete a set of social tasks and claim your NFT

Development already began:

Meeting with Timo Ruether (from WAX) on the 18th to discuss additional features/tweaks as they have specific use cases.
  
  
### 2) wax.drop.bountyblok.io

Status: RELEASED

In the last 30 days there have been:
Total Distributions: 1,530 distributions! This amounts to 501,900 NFTs minted + transferred.

16 new projects whitelisted in the last 30 days

WHAT'S NEXT: scaling our atomicassets DB to allow us to perform SQL queries directly on the postgres db without affecting the public API - this will allow us to add additional features and expand the tool.


### 3) wax.giftnft.io

Status: RELEASED

In the last 30 days there's approximately 800 NFTs gifted to friends, family etc via Email and Twitter DMs.

WHAT'S NEXT: Started building out a new feature to allow these types of QR campaigns like in conference or any physical location around the world: https://twitter.com/KennethBosak/status/1466067941015932932?s=20 which is based on geolocation. The problem with WAX's QR image in the above example is that once posted on Twitter anyone can scan and claim it. With our new feature we leverage geolocation and limit the NFT to be claimed within a radius, by physically being at the conference. Speaking with Marty this will allow them to run physical promotional campaigns in 2022 like treasure hunts.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

### 1) novopangea.io

The [Novopangea Players Hub](https://hub.novopangea.io) is now open for all members. Players can now see their collection of cards inside of the Players as well as the Creator Credits they have earned thus far. They opened a voting round to beta testers to ensure voting functionality was working correctly. After successfully passing the Q&A they have now opened up a 2nd round of story mode voting to all users. 

![img](https://i.ibb.co/PWLfstT/nono-hub.png)

The land claim event for those that have been accumulating Creator Credits will be open on January 19th. Players will be able to go in and redeem land claims in preparation for the upcoming release of Novopangea game mode. Players will be able to use their credits to choose land claims across any of the six realms. 

The first phase of the game mode which will be economy play is expected to be released in Q1 of this year.



### 2) harmoniagoya.io

We met Jerome and Virgin, and their team about a year ago within the Tezos community. They are a high end game studio (playtix.io) based in Strasbourg, France, and finally hopped on WAX. playtix.io (parent company) launched harmoniagoya.io - 

Harmonia Goyaâ€™s Land is the first blockchain game combining a farming simulation with quests to take care of your residents, customize your farm and create items and clothing.

Their collection is live and have been constantly engaging their community with WAX marketing campaigns in the last few weeks. Example: https://givelab.com/9ug6cr/harmonia-goyas-land-wax-giveaway

From the founder: A beta is going to be launched next month (reduced map, reduced actions but gives an overview of the animals and if you take good care of them, you'll be rewarded). HmX will be a fractional NFT instead of a crypto token (our vision is to be mass-market with tokeneconomics). V1 will be live in October this year. 

Their discord https://discord.gg/srVm2cNH with a community already at 2.73K.

Their team: ![img](https://i.ibb.co/tMBy5Yv/playtix-team.png)

Their collection [harmoniapass](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/template/harmoniagoya/382749) is now live and soon to be whitelisted by Jona as per our recent chat.

Check out the [Harmonia Lite paper](https://playtix.notion.site/Harmonia-Lite-paper-de55575b28124667b7dc6833dfaf1e40) and the roadmap: ![img](https://i.ibb.co/74fwLYK/roadmap2-1.jpg)

David personally wanted me to connect them a few days ago to discuss further potential collab (TBD).


### 3) masscult.co/waxify

Our tech partner masscult (previously known as monomyth) are taking waxify to the next level. Waxify is the first Shopify app that provides artists, brands, and other online retailers a simple way to bundle digital collectibles minted on the Wax blockchain and physical items from one storefront in the same transaction.

Grant (founder) went to LA and met David Kim from WAX over the holidays (they had coffee), and Waxify came at the right time because WAX is focused on building games and can now offload IPs to agencies such as masscult and Waxify.

### 4) Additional updates from various brands

#### January (TBD)
- Leaf Trading Cards (Drop 2 - IP TBD)
- Slipknot (TBD) - this will be the conclusion of the Chapel Town Rag campaign

#### February
- Gourmet NFT collection (Using Waxify for Wordress / Gated Content Recipe site)
- Leaf Trading Cards (Drop 3 - IP TBD)

#### March
- Megadeth x Gibson Guitar Collection (Drop 1) (vIRL physical+digital)
- Boys of Summer / Sandlot Drop 2

Also in discussion with some another really big global brand and some pretty big IP estate collections in the world of sports, music, photography and more. TBD.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We run and maintain multiple NFT discord bots that engage users with rewards.

We are also mods on Novopangea https://discord.gg/NSypBXcz and Harmonia Goya's Land: https://discord.gg/srVm2cNH

We got the first WAX highlight! https://twitter.com/WAX_io/status/1470833673830346760 

We started getting the community involved in producing some of our content via paid gigs as there's a lot of hidden talent out there for example:

[@TheOnlineInn](https://twitter.com/TheOnlineInn) produced a short video how to mint on demand using our tool which will help beginners immensely: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKf6gsBO1hs
What's cool about this video is that the artist also used his own produced music as the background music. Another great example: https://twitter.com/TheOnlineInn/status/1478033932092379136?s=20 to listen to their custom track.


## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

No
