## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

a) We run and maintain multiple NFT discord bots that engage users with rewards. 

b) We helped WAX mint the 10,000,000 NFTs which took about 10 days. This was actually a lot harder than we expected - We had to make sure we don't congest the network, handle various errors from different accounts that are system contracts, and various other exceptions during the process.

Example errors:

assertion failure with message: The world has ended

assertion failure with message: No Autolist found

assertion failure with message: Unsupported template.

assertion failure with message: cannot_mint_to_self_account

assertion failure with message: Invalid drop-id


In other words it wasn't simply a script you let run and forget.
