Datacenter Network Glitches: About a month ago sudden issues with OVH Roubaix Datacenter but decided to keep the BP running there regardless (instead of switching to the backup BP, informed Kaefer at the time) just to see how it behaves with intermittent network issues on-site, it autofixes itself after occassional glitches. After 1 week of testing we decided to switch to a different BP as those issues never got resolved. Unfortunately, a few weeks later we retested and that datacenter still caused awkward network glitches - we don't recommend OVH Roubaix for now to any Guilds.

Upgraded atomicassets to 1.3.11

12900K Testing: Tested the new 12900K on Hetzner for about 2 weeks and is in fact quite amazing as a BP in terms of performance as shown here: https://www.alohaeos.com/tools/benchmarks#networkId=11&timeframeId=8&outliers=0 between March 18 - March 31 - unfortunately they come with non-ECC RAM and we knew about this and even had chats with Stan a few weeks ago, and we just wanted to confirm it - it does indeed lead to random RAM access violation and could happen at any time. We don't recommend non-ECC to nodeos servers especially BP nodes as WAX Mainnet has grown a lot and the odds of an invalid pointer is much higher now.
 
Due to increasing number of forks lately across different guilds, between eosrio and bountyblokbp, we provided a private peer to Igor which helped resolve our forks - eventually more and more guilds will need to do this with their neighboring peers.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We run and maintain multiple NFT discord bots that engage users with rewards. 

NOTE: We have been running these bots for several months and noticed last month we got no points for it.

For example Onessus products rely on our bots and we also had a call with the honeycomb dev 2 weeks ago to combine forces and build new cool features on discord.

He is currently working on a high level document TBD.


## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

No
