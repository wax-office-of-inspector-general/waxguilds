## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?


### 1) novopangea.io

Novo hub user base grew by 27% between the months of May and April. 

They completed the first phase of their building sale with 750 building assets per realm 4500 Building Assets total having sold out. 

They released Skilled Workers to support the 4500 building assets that have been released across the eco-system. Skilled Workers can be used by building owners to supply labor to their buildings. Players that do not own a building can purchase Skilled Worker NFTs and can look for work when the game play commences. This is going to be one of the great features of the Novo game where building owners will need to find a balance of directly hiring their own teams of workers as well as outsourcing to other players to find their labor. This will enable NOVO to target a range of users who have different budgets but want to participate and earn within the game play. 

The first phase of the game economy version 1.0 was certified this past week by Machinations and plan to release the report to the community over the coming week. 

The team finalized its investor deck and has begun the process of now commencing conversations with potential third parties for the intital seed phase. They will be looking to close the seed round over the coming months with a Private and Public round to follow. 

The team will be working with the Blockchain Center over the summer on the token launch plans. The plan is for NOVO to be avaiable as an ERC-20, BEP-20 as well as on Wax. A token bridge will be established before the Public offering as they plan to introduce a Staking mechanism within the game to support leveling up mechanics within the game. 

The team will be attending NFT NYC and will be presenting an overview of the Novopangea game / project at the event. 

Paul Lieberman the co-founder of Draft Kings and lead of Draft Kings NFT initiatives has signed on as a project advisor. Paul has been a colleague of one of the members of the team and is excited to share this project with his investor network. 

The game launch was slated for June 11th but due to an intial dev sprint that was added to include some more features they plan to delay the release until June 25th.

An annoucement will be going to the community this week.
