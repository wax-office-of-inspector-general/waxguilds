## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We attended NFT NYC, met everyone there at the WAX booth + WAX rooftop private party. While there we helped promote the WAX game by merging our partners: novopangea + masscult/waxify to generate these cards and pass them around during NFT NYC. Warwick+Mike (novopangea) + Dimitri (bountyblok) had them ready and passed them around during that week in NYC.
