## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Will only be posting NEW relevant updates/changes in the last 30 days

NEW: 

### 1) novopangea.io

There have been TONS of updates here but will just keep it super short (don't hesitate to reach for questions)

The team has finished the NFT upgrade work. This was a beast of a project but players will be able to upgrade building and worker mutable data by spending in game resources. This now gives novo the foundation for a lot of the remaining features they plan to release for the eco stage of the game. Players will be able to expand their playing into other realms with the release of Travel passes.

A second drop will be coming in Nov with a residential building released in conjunction. Realm resources will follow with $novo releasing in Dec or early Jan.

The player base grew by 25% the past 30 days. They will begin putting marketing dollars towards the game as the features continue to expand.


### 4) masscult.co/waxify

NEW IP: https://horrorharbor.io/

### 8) WAX + Ethereum: NDA

Still on-going


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

Worked with Jared from the WAX Team to help launched a AMC Giveway via giftnft for AMC shareholders to claim a unique badge on WAX.

AMC was very happy with the results and we are now working on a 2nd one next week.

This was the example email being sent out to the hundred of thousands of shareholders with links to our giftnft claim page.
