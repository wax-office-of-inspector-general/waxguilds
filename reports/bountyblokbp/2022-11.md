Continuing to support/maintain the wax.bountyblok.io APIs/Portal, the distribution drop tool, GIFT NFT, and now the new "Contests by bountyblok" portal.


### 1) bountyblok gamification APIs

Status: RELEASED

The API made approx 8,013,027 edtech/fintech type of task on-chain to our endpoint in the last 30 days across the several websites and webapps who use bountyblok such as stocktrak.com, howthermarketworks.com, personalfinancelabs.com, finlitchallenge.com

### 2) wax.drop.bountyblok.io

Status: RELEASED

- Total Distributions: 1,891 distributions! 
- This amounts to 140,625 NFTs minted + transferred, among other types of engagement.


### 3) wax.giftnft.io

Status: RELEASED

In the last 30 days there's approximately 261 NFTs gifted to friends, family etc via Email and Twitter DMs.

AMC Claims: 49,838 times

Major update:

We have redesigned a new portion of the giftnft tool to allow web2 projects to connect their existing mailing list (via sendgrid) in just a few clicks, and easily send out personalized NFTs to those emails.

This is a major feature because it opens the door to traditional brands who want to gift NFTs to their community via email.

The NFTs are generated via atomicassets claimable private/public key mechanism.

We have been working closely with the WAX team on these requirements so that David Pava, Jared, Marty etc could create massive email campaigns in December.
