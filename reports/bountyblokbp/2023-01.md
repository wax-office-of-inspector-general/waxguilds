Ability to suggest marketing tweets based on a few keywords. This is a first step into this integration as we plan to expand further where end-users can share a tweet that is generated dynamically on demand for a unique viral marketing experience.

Right now using this integration allows projects to generate smart marketing Tweets.

GAME UPDATES:

"Our Game continues to evolve and improve, and we are excited to announce that the Bulk Set Rent feature for Residential Buildings will be launching this week. This will allow players to bulk the Set Rent for their residential buildings and also set their desired rental rate. You can do this from the inventory UI if you want to set the same rental rate for all your residential buildings. You can set rents individually if you wish to if the preference is to have varying rates in certain districts. The choice is yours.

We are continuing to prioritize bulk UX enhancements. It's the team's priority to continue focusing on these areas of the Game to improve the overall gameplay.

A Huge thank you to Springbok for all his hard work over the holidays, as he worked extremely hard on performance improvements to speed up load times and render UI modals more quickly."
