## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

1) We plan to upgrade all our node to 3.1.x in the week of March 6, by March 10 latest.

2) During that `miningcontract` subj queue attack we blacklisted the that account on our peers and for some weird reason our BP crashed with io exceptions. We missed a few rounds because of that but I spoke to Stan and we just blamed it on old software. So we just failed over to backup BP for now until we upgrade to 3.1.x.

3) We decommissioned our Public AA servers (SHIP Node, AA Filler, Read Replica) to save on costs in this market. We will bring it back later this year.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Will only be posting NEW relevant updates/changes in the last 30 days

NEW: 

### 1) novopangea.io

Its been a busy month for the Novopangea Team across the Wax Eco-system. Lands being capped within the game, a Lands Rewards program coming out at the end of March as well as a Private sale of $NOVO, Alcor release on $NOVO and $NOVO staking within the game. 

This has resulted in the best month the team has seen for user growth as well as significant spike in secondary sales. The team has now jumped into the top five for games on WAX as they continue to acquire new users to the game. 

The team will be releasing more updates in March which will include more building upgrades as well as the much awaited Skilled Worker automatic assignment. We expect to see a significant uptick in Skilled Worker asset acquisition when that feature goes live. 

There's also PFPs which the team is calling Passport photos on deck as well as the early stages of PVP in development. 



### 2) horrorharbor.io

no new updates


### 3) Physical Graffiti

### 4) avalonthegame.com

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We are collaborating a lot with PINK lately.

Several calls with pink team in anticipation to the ultraman launch

https://bk.atomichub.io/

https://wax.contest.bountyblok.io/contest/a13b2df7-9f62-4225-8540-1e4bd1f11193

We collaborate closely with projects more than end users since they are our main customers and we gather feedback it's been incredible.

We also sent some customers to EOSUSA Michael's paid/infra service for dedicate API endpoints. He has been AMAZING towards our partners masscult.co 

We are in a lot of telegram groups, slack channels, and discord groups with project builders offering free support for all our tools.

Also being a validator on Polygon we know that world quite well and always keep an eye for possible WAX <> Polygon synergies, even had calls with Jassy/Marty discuss ideas

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

No
