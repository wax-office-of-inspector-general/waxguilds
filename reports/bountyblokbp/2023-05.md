## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

NFTOPIA leverage bountyblok tools and was quite a successful event:

There were 40+ live streamed 1 hour interviews in 3 days which included HOURLY bountyblok contests, and a huge SWAG contest. 50-100 live viewers steady, and 670+ attendees. Next convention is end of July! :)

There was a partnership with "Nuvo" which let people get a badge and attribute points to it by clicking links from all the booths. So on the bountyblok booth, people that get a bunch of points level up at milestones, and are airdropped WAX NFT versions of their level badges.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

No
