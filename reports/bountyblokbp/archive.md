**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

Missed 13 rounds on June 15 - “unlinkable_block_exception” This can happen on a busy network but we had some outdated/invalid peers which made it more difficult to recover. We updated our peers list since.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

bountyblok has launched additional Discord bots on Onessus server that airdrops NFTs randomly throughout the day on certain channels. Currently on Heros discord and soon on WAX’s official discord.

Gift NFT now has a Claimable feature via QR code. This will allow Twitter Ads Campaign to embed a QR code where external users could claim NFTs via QR code. This is live but will be activated by WAX/Marty in a week or 2.

Drop tool has been revamped/redesigned - design phase is done and we’re currently integrating/coding - new UI should go live in the next 2 weeks or so.

## April 2021

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

1. We upgraded to v2.0.11wax01

2. We setup an internal peer behind Wireguard and joined Sweden’s network

3. We launched hyperion with full SHIP for V1/V2:

[https://api.wax.bountyblok.io/v2/docs/index.html](https://api.wax.bountyblok.io/v2/docs/index.html)

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

1. [wax.bountyblok.io](http://wax.bountyblok.io/) - Gamification API Portal

We continue to maintain and update. Recently improved our validation tool to detect odd premium accounts such as `anyo` during validation for the airdrop tool.

1. [giftnft.io](http://giftnft.io/) - this is now on added on [wallet.wax.io](http://wallet.wax.io/)

We also developed giftnft API which is currently being tested by EOSUSA for their Rewards program on Alien Worlds.

1. [drop.bountyblok.io](http://drop.bountyblok.io/) Airdrop NFT distribution tool used by 80+ NFT projects

The [drop.bountyblok.io](http://drop.bountyblok.io/) also has a new feature allowing promoters to mint-on-demand NFTs to WAX accounts from the promo Tweet’s comments. There was a huge demand for this as many projects would manually copy the accounts names into an Excel sheet.

This feature also leverages our `validate_accounts` API [https://docs.bountyblok.io/wax/validate_accounts](https://docs.bountyblok.io/wax/validate_accounts) so they don’t have to worry if WAX accounts are valid on chain.

## March 2021

- bountyblokbp
- **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations criteria? Please provide details.**We upgraded to v2.0.10wax01We stopped supporting V1 history as it is deprecated (even from block.one) and barely used in generalWe setup new infra to support atomicassets API and Graphql:[https://api.wax-aa.bountyblok.io/atomicassets/docs/swagger/](https://api.wax-aa.bountyblok.io/atomicassets/docs/swagger/)[https://api.wax-aa.bountyblok.io/v1/graphql](https://api.wax-aa.bountyblok.io/v1/graphql)
- **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development criteria? Please provide details.**We continue to maintain and update [bountyblok.io](http://bountyblok.io/) on WAX Mainnet [https://wax.bountyblok.io](https://wax.bountyblok.io/) and the giftnft tool [https://wax.giftnft.io](https://wax.giftnft.io/)The NFT Drop tool has had additional tweaks and bug fixes. We also added burn tracking allowing projects to add gamification mechanics to accounts who burned certain NFTs while holding certain other NFTs. We are getting requests to access the tools on a daily basis at this point.

- **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement criteria? Please provide details.**Still very hands-on across several TG groups and multiple WAX projects. Helping various community members with general and technical support.We launched a twitter/typeform campaign about 2 weeks ago: [https://twitter.com/bountyblok/status/1369272680474632193?s=20](https://twitter.com/bountyblok/status/1369272680474632193?s=20)[https://qx856avucbu.typeform.com/to/OpifIvz9](https://qx856avucbu.typeform.com/to/OpifIvz9)This led to nearly 100 typeform submissions since then. We are constantly responding to each project and will continue to do so in the next few weeks as well. Some wanted to learn more about NFTs, others wanted to move from opensea and join WAX, and a lot of them already knew about atomichub and wanted to set up shop, and use our tools to promote their project.Additionally, there has been a lot of synergies between our team and Pink’s team in the last few weeks because Pink would refer us to projects looking for Airdrop capabilities, and we would refer to them projects looking for a packing/unpacking service, creating a complementary experience to the NFT project.

All our nodes have been upgraded to v2.0.9wax01

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

- Very hands-on across several TG groups and multiple WAX projects. Helping various community members with general and technical support. We have a new support group for the NFT Drop and the GIFT tools @bountybloknft as support has been increasing.New API available for free for everyone on WAX:API: [https://api.bountyblok.io/wax/validate_accounts](https://api.bountyblok.io/wax/validate_accounts)Docs: [https://docs.bountyblok.io/wax/validate_accounts](https://docs.bountyblok.io/wax/validate_accounts)Use case: There is currently no way to filter out a list of accounts that can contain invalid WAX accounts. The problem with this is when you send multiple ACTIONS in a TRANSACTION it will fail and the user does not clearly know which account was the culprit.There is also no way right now with the EOSIO RPC API to know which account is invalid unless you call /get_account one by one which is not feasible when you need to check 5000 accounts.Our NFT Airdrop required something like this since promoters on twitter gather account names via comments in various ways and they sometimes get inputted with a typo, so when they paste a list of 1000 account names, it’s not clear which one is invalid.This tool allows you to filter out, programmatically, a large list of account names with a clear response on how many are OK/Invalid, and sanitizes the list with a new list without invalid WAX Accounts.The data comes from the table on chain: eosio:userres ([https://wax.bloks.io/account/eosio?loadContract=true&tab=Tables&account=eosio&scope=eosio&limit=100&table=userres](https://wax.bloks.io/account/eosio?loadContract=true&tab=Tables&account=eosio&scope=eosio&limit=100&table=userres))We then have a daily job that checks eosio:newaccount actions and store the incremental new accounts. This tool can be used by anyone in the WAX community.

## August 2020

Came back!

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

We have upgraded our API nodes in terms of hardware and geo location (from US to France). We have been participating in the testnet upgrades and testing currently on v2.0.6wax02.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

1. bountyblok.io

We continue to maintain and update bountyblok on WAX Mainnet.

Bountyblok has written over 5M WAX transactions on Mainnet to date and growing, from the various WAX dapps and from our enterprise customers (howthemarketworks.com, personalfinancelab.com, …)

Current Weekly Avg WAX TXs: ~55K

Lifetime WAX TXs: 5.3M

WAX dapps like KARMA, HodlGod, boxmaze, and so on, leverage our gamification tools and save time from re-inventing the wheel on certain gaming mechanics.

HodlGod recently launched their 3D version currently in Alpha, and their team requested specific types of Leaderboards, the new XP and Leveling system, and Read-only API keys so we built what was necessary to help their needs at no cost as we keep planning to promote WAX.

WAX is now our default EOSIO chain when anyone signs up to bountyblok externally without any referral.

We also started working on https://wax.bountyblok.io a themed version specifically for WAX users and dapps.

bountyblok will remain free to all WAX dapps in order to promote and grow the ecosystem.

2. Zapier.com

This is a big feature that has been recently approved by Zapier.com and went live specifically for the WAX community. This integration allows you to gamify your Twitter following by awarding them score points, User XP, Achievements, level them up, and so on. We have been quiet about this while in Beta, but we have some WAX Community members and Guilds using this feature in the past few weeks to promote their Twitter by tracking users and rewarding them with NFTs.

EOS Nation, WAX Sweden, boxmaze are some examples who have been using this to promote their Twitter with WAX related events, and rewarding users with NFTs. This will keep evolving as we already received tons of feedback from Stephane, Anders etc.

https://zapier.com/apps/bountyblok/integrations

https://docs.bountyblok.io/zapier/twitter-integration

We are also working with Zapier.com marketing team to make a big announcement in the next coming weeks.

2. personalfinancelab.com is now exclusively on WAX (via bountyblok, soon their own smart contract). This is a major budgeting and educational website in the US that is bringing > 5000 daily transactions per day and growing on WAX Mainnet. We are working with them to deploy their own smart contract in the next few weeks as well.

3. Connected Michael Blu with Evan in a collaboration effort to bring https://uplift.art to WAX. A new project involving charitable events powered by Audio NFTs on WAX (not seeking points**)

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

Very hands-on across several TG groups and multiple WAX projects. Helping various community members with general and technical support.

We have dedicated private groups setup with several WAX projects:

Some examples:

In a group with Joel Comm/BCHeroes + WAX Core team, bountyblok helped him with some of their BCHeroes Air Drops based on specific requests and custom scripts.

In a group with Dante from HodlGod where we are helping them with their project providing support, advice, help with testing, custom API tools etc.

In a group with Kogs helping Ben and Glen with their launch and introducing them to various projects/contacts in the space, discussing referral systems etc.

Helping Johan from boxmaze with gamification advice/ideas as they prepare to launch on WAX

Active and Admin (main wax group) across several WAX related TG:

https://t.me/waxXkogs

https://t.me/WaxTradeTalk

https://t.me/sfnft

...

Maintaining https://www.bountyblok.io/wax-activity/ as a Telegram monitor/activity as some members use this. We’ll be enhancing it as we’ve received quite some feedback and ideas.

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

No, you guys are doing great - maybe v1 history shouldn’t be worth that many points? Maybe I’m wrong, otherwise good work.

Been following the OIG guidelines changes as a retired BP since January, and it has evolved quite nicely.

## February 2020

Maybe add examples to these questions? Otherwise not really.

# Pre-Evaluation Form Responses

### Please provide some information regarding when and how your Guild got involved with the EOSIO or WAX ecosystem. Links to resources are helpful.

We built a product called [bountyblok.io](http://bountyblok.io/) that is currently on EOS Mainnet and soon on WAX, and Evan Vandenberg and others from the WAX team highly recommended we apply to become a guild. We our a tech team and dev shop based here in Montreal, Canada.

### Has anyone in the Guild previously produced blocks on an EOSIO or DPOS network in the past? If so, which ones and what nodes did they help operate?

No we have never ran a BP, however we are closely involved with the community, and have formed great relationships with some of the greatest advisors for this, such as Michael Yeates, Eric from EOS Sweden, etc.

### If your Guild has a warrant canary, please provide the link to it.

### If your Guild has a live video inspection of your infrastructure, please provide the link to it.

### Please provide information regarding projects that your Guild is working on to improve the WAX ecosystem. Information about plans, progress, and timelines is helpful. This includes projects that have been submitted for the WAX Guild Showcase program.

Our product is [bountyblok.io](http://bountyblok.io/), a gamification platform allows dapps to create challenges with tasks and incentivise their users to engage more with the dapp. We are currently on EOS Mainnet and Worbli, WAX has been very interested with adding it to the WAX Chain as a tool that will benefit dapps. In addition, WAX's internal team, Evan, Mark, Dan, etc all have several use cases on leveraging bountyblok to promote user engagement for WAX and the WAX dapps down the road.

### Please state the jurisdiction your Guild is domiciled in, as well as the jurisdiction that your Guild's nodes are deployed in.

Our office and company is in Montreal, Quebec, Canada - the nodes are on AWS East Region

### Please share any usage metrics you have, if any. This includes data specific to applications and user activity driven to the WAX ecosystem as a result of your Guild's efforts.

### If possible, please share information about businesses that your Guild is engaging with that are seeking to learn about and leverage the WAX ecosystem in some way.

There's nothing concrete at the moment but we do have a lot of customers in the mainstream space with established websites and web products that will eventually like to get more into the crypto space and use some of the blockchain tech. Things such as using WAX Login to authenticate to their existing systems, while being able to earn and move around WAX Assets. We see a lot of opportunities down the road.

### Please share any information regarding community building efforts championed by your Guild. This can be facilitating translation of documentation, organizing meetups, and otherwise driving social and human engagement within the platform.

We have a free tier plan on bountyblok allowing dapps to try it out for free, we are also working with dfuse (also in Montreal near us) with new features bountyblok needs that will also be valuable to other dapps on WAX down the road.

### Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

I think so far things are quite smooth, this form UX was great.

Notes

- Strong relationship with WAX team due to gamification
- Strong tech team, haven't run a public node yet.
