* Added a link to drop tool on contests dashboard.
* We are still in the process of upgrading our Contest Tool to the latest version of Angular. This includes significant changes to support server-side rendering (SSR), which improves performance and SEO. Deploying an Angular SSR application to our server requires a considerable amount of effort, as it involves configuring both the front-end and server environments to work seamlessly together.
  
* A few bug fixes
