- **Description** Alcor Yield Farming is Alcor DEX newest feature. Its release marks a significant milestone in Alcor's goal of improving DeFi within the WAX ecosystem. Alcor Farms harnesses the power of concentrated liquidity capital efficiency and takes it to the next level by incentivizing users to provide liquidity into the most traded pairs on WAX.

Yield farming is: 

-Completely contract-sided
-No backend involved in reward distribution
-Users keep their liquidity (as there is no liquidity token on Alcor SWAP v2)
-Users collect fees generated from providing liquidity **ON TOP** of incentives

Goals: 

-Encourage users to provide liquidity while keeping all DEX interactions on-chain. 

-Improving WAX DeFi by providing rewards to WAX/USDT and (TOKEN)/USDT pairs, refer to confidential information sent. 

-Increase WAXP TVL across the ecosystem.

-Establish strong liquidity pools on EOS and WAX, allowing IBC pairs to be traded between chains smoothly (WAX/EOS WAX/USDT EOS/USDT)
