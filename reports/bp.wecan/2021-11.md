## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Block producer nodes, full api and seed nodes have been setup for mainnet and testnet.
Testnet block producer has been producing blocks since Aug 2021.
Based on Aloha benchmark we have one of the fastest block producers on the testnet to date, with execution time of less than 0.25 ms.

With exception of one occasion on September when we tested our block producer failover, and one occasion on November when we deployed new keys and didn't know how to do it properly, we missed 2 rounds overall

![reliability](block_reliability_3_months.png)

All misconceptions about managing the bp nodes have been taken into account and we have created special measures to avoid having problems like this in the future.
Despite the above, we still have 99.9% round and block availability over 3 months.
Seed and full api nodes have been set up and ready for the public use.
We are working hard to bring up a reliable Hyperion and History API clusters to the public.

Almost all crucial validations have been passed:
https://validate.eosnation.io/wax/producers/bp.wecan.html
https://validate.eosnation.io/waxtest/producers/wecan.html

What has been already done:
1. Manual BP failover has been tested and we are now working on automating it. Two different providers and block producer monitoring has been set up with an automated on-call when we detect missing blocks from us.
2. Full API nodes with account query and wallet compatibility (tested on Anchor). 2 nodes for testnet and mainnet have been setup in different regions to provide datacenter failover ability. All requests are served thorough proxy. No rate limits have been imposed yet.
3. 2 seed nodes for testnet and mainnet are provided and fully functional with 50 clients connections per each node.
4. We have two fully functional history APIs which are not available for the public yet.
5. All our nodes are operating on the latest stable v2.0.12.
6. We've started testing v2.0.13 on one testnet node and plan to upgrade all other nodes when it proves stable for us.
7. Created pubic backup source for history and snapshots.

What we're working on right now:
1. Automated failover for block producers.
2. Measuring load and figuring out the most applicable rate limits.
3. Providing most recent snapshots and block logs for node setup.
4. Highly available Hyperion cluster.
5. Atomic assets API research.
6. Oracle price pusher.
7. Updating public backup endpoint to contain the most recent block, snapshot and state history backups.

Most of our operations effort right now is concentrated on setting up Hyperion nodes.
The biggest challenge is to find the correct set up procedure which will not break anything after we get the node synced.
Currently updating from 3.x tp 3.3.x requires full reindexing and we're working on figuring out the most stable setup.

####Tribal Books

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

####NFT.NYC
 Recently our ambassador Bonz Manifest took part in the NFT.NYC Conference, telling the whole crypto community about the huge potential of the WAX as the best chain for crypto games. We believe it’s the best way to grow the community with new people.

Also, each of our projects has its own system of users engagements which has a direct impact on the whole WAX ecosystem development:

####R-Planet Staking System
The NFT Staking System enables receiving Aether rewards for staking NFTs of listed projects. It drow attention to the partnering projects helping the whole ecosystem to evolve.
####Prospectors Referal Program
Thanks to a unique referral link, each Prospectors player gets a percentage of the income of players invited in the game by him.   Thereafter players have a great stimulus to invite more people into the game and the community.

####Enchanting Mana: Tribal Books NFT Staking System
The pre-game NFT staking system with a regular claim of MANA token is supposed to activate Tribal Books users and bring more people into the project.
