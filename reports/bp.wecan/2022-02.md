What has been done:
1. Deployed AtomicAssets API cluster to Public Mainnet https://atomic-wax-mainnet.wecan.dev/health
2. Deployed Hyperion API to Public Testnet https://hyperion-wax-testnet.wecan.dev/v2/health
3. Deployed public status page that allows to check our sites and Public APIs availability https://status.wecan.dev/
4. Decreased the amount of p2p nodes, but increased p2p connection stability and availability. Three separate global zones are still available.
5. Matching all the necessary technical criteria stated in https://www.notion.so/v4-Office-of-Inspector-General-Guidelines-ed0bddf9f11f424d8b6e371fa6e4d5ab

What we're working on right now:
1. Hyperion upgrade to 3.3.5 version. A separate cluster indexing is still in progress. Most likely should be ready by April.
2. WIP on backup server which will contain temporarily uncompressed daily wax history snapshots and atomic postgres backups
3. RnD of possibility of Elastic snapshot groups (we have backup servers with enough disk capacity, but it's not clear whether it's feasible to do elastic snapshots by our own means)

**The launch of the Big Update**
This event took place February 15th and presented the R-Planet Governance and a new UI, where all the managing and DeFi tools of the player are gathered together.

**The RDAO distribution**
The first phase of the RDAO distribution involved an airdrop among the most active players. There were 4049 accounts on the list. The second phase of RDAO distribution has been arranged through the auctions in the pools of pairs RDAO-Aether and RDAO-APH. These auctions happen in parallel with each other on a daily basis.

Within the Big Update started **The R-Planet Staking System 2.0**. It has been changed and expanded functionality. The main difference of the staking rules for the third-party projects is that players decide which of the listed projects will mine Aether, and how much, by voting for them with their Aether. Only NFTs of the top 21 projects from all listed are able to mine Aether.
