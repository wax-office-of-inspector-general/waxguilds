**Project development: R-Planet Game**

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

**miningnetwork.io**
* Status: **release/in development**
* Website: https://miningnetwork.io/

Ongoing work with contract and security audits, product development and project startup.
Still helping to set up the collection and resolve potential issues at the Atomic Hub.

**WAX Backup services**

We made a research on the available snapshot services (ref. [link](#https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/waxguilds/issues/306))
All registered block producers that exposed their snapshot endpoint info over bp.json were manually validated and tested and gathered into one comparison table:
https://github.com/We-Can-dev/wax-snapshot-resources/blob/main/README.md
Note: dates are relevant for the moment of publication.
Our WAX snapshot service still remains one of the few, because it's the only one that constantly provides the most recent FULL Mainnet and Testnet history snapshots (and now AA backups).
It would be great to incentivize all the active members of WAX infrastructure to provide the means to quickly spin up private or public WAX infrastructure.
The more locations and all kinds of snapshots, the easier and faster it would be to bring new active members.

**Delphioracle**

We've published ready-to-use docker image for those who want to quickly spin up delphioracle updater service

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

**R-Planet**

A partnership with ARK Infernum, a new game on the WAX blockchain. AETHER is already stackable in their staking system!  Players can stake their tokens to earn ARK tokens. Announced the partnership and ran a giveaway.

For the first time in the R-Planet, universal robots have been sold for Aether (https://rplanet.medium.com/the-sale-of-universal-robots-for-aether-96fc266ff93b).

Partnership with NFT Horizon - one of the first websites that keeps everyone up-to-date about everything that happens in the WAX community. The first blog post due to partnership was for engaging new players to the R-Planet and explained what to do newcomers (https://nfthorizon.io/what-you-need-to-know-about-r-planet/).


*The Ambassadors for R-Planet*

The Ambassadors program for R-Planet was introduced on April 1 (https://rplanet.medium.com/welcome-to-the-r-planet-ambassadors-club-55e520a32e57). R-Planet has already defined five active appliers (https://rplanet.medium.com/cheers-the-april-r-planet-ambassadors-822ee060a7da).
This program has been arranged to stimulate projects listed within the R-Planet Staking Hub to promote R-Planet and the whole wax ecosystem in various ways. Such as publication within social media, different cross-project cooperation, NFT blends, development of useful tools, etc.


*New projects have been added to the Staking Hub*

A few more projects have been added to the R-Planet Staking Hub. Every project listed on the R-Planet brings its users to R-Planet, making them a part of our community and a part of the WAX community as well.
Also, projects compete with each other for a bigger Aether mining pool encouraging their users to vote for them with Aether. That increases Aether usage and expands the amount of Aether holders.
List of the projects added to the staking Hub during the period since the last report: Neon Space, Rawr!, NFT Horizon, Androbots, Secret Saviors, Elven World.

*Live stream*

Have been running weekly livestreams  https://www.twitch.tv/rplanet. Community had a chance to see the gameplay and new features of the Conquest game.
