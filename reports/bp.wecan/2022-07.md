What has been done:
1. We've completed work on our Atomic backups last month and successfully providing Mainnet and Testnet pg dumps https://backup.wecan.dev/wax/atomic/ for more than a month.
2. Completed our work on weekly Hyperion elastic snapshots for Mainnet and Testnet https://backup.wecan.dev/wax/hyperion/. Successfully tested snapshot restores which amounts to 1-1.5 weeks now.
3. Updated Testnet BP, API and P2P nodes to NodeOS 2.0.14wax01.
4. Matching all the necessary technical criteria stated in https://wax-oig.notion.site/v4-3-Office-of-Inspector-General-Guidelines-DRAFT-96f8c7191a4449a0ab0aea3a01415893

What we're working on right now:
1. Multi provider automated failover of our public sites to reduce dependency on vendor failures.
2. Proceed with testing new NodeOS versions and rollout to Mainnet.
3. Testing subjective billing options on Testnet and gradual rollout to Mainnet.
4. Working on rolling our WAX pairs of Aether and PGL to delphioracle pusher.
5. We also started drafting on one unannounced project that we think can help to expand the adoption of WAX for private companies.

We’ve been doing the last preparation before the launch of the alpha version.
Working on the texts, game balance, and features (army managements, battles, journaling, and blockchain integration).
Firstly the alpha will be available on the mobile, later - on the web.

On June 16th we held the crafting of robots event. It was announced at R_Planet socials, at NFT Horizon and NFT Insider media and their socials.

We continued our Partnership with NFT Horizon - one of the first websites that keeps everyone up-to-date about everything that happens in the WAX community.
The second blog post due to partnership explained about the Crafting System of R-Planet (https://nfthorizon.io/what-is-the-crafting-system-of-r-planet/).

We have weekly livestreams  https://www.twitch.tv/rplanet. So far we have started a new format.
We began to invite the R-Planet ambassadors and partners. The first guest was Ulas from NFT Horizon (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6o--XeU3FI).  

Ulas talked about the importance of collaboration for the participants of the WAX ecosystem.
He also explained some of the details and mechanics of NFT Horizon’s own NFT collection including the tokenization of literature, and their plans to create an influential hub for developers.

We have created a promo video for Conquest Game   https://twitter.com/RPLANETio/status/1537480127998615552?s=20&t=Fjc4L4CV8sdnaW8dW5QQHw .

Also posted the clear video about R-Planet minerals created by Corp.
World NFT, one of our Ambassadors https://twitter.com/RPLANETio/status/1538894088279302144?s=20&t=Fjc4L4CV8sdnaW8dW5QQHw.

We helped to successfully start the game regardless of a few non-technical hiccups that happened in the process.
The game has solid support from the community which is constantly growing and showed good volumes of involvement.

Updates:
1. Implemented "CryptoBank" - a mechanism of buyout of BTK (internal token) with help of commission that comes from AtomicHub.
2. Implemented new game mechanics: "Scripts" and "Exploits" - new type of NFT-cards which can be used for "Asics" and bump their characteristics for some period of time.
3. Based on WeCan team's recommendations, there were made additional changes for the sake of CPU usage reduction:
   a) Upgrades of NFT cards - now user don't have to execute too many actions in order to upgrade card up to multiple levels - everything is being executed in a single optimized method.
   b) Acquisition of mined SHARES from cards - now getting shares from all NFT cards is being executed in a single method which reduced CPU usage by ~60%.

**WAX Backup services**
* Website: https://backup.wecan.dev/

Now we provide full spectrum of all backups for most used API and TX history solutions on WAX https://backup.wecan.dev/.
Full WAX history snapshots https://backup.wecan.dev/wax/, full Atomic Assets DB dumps https://backup.wecan.dev/wax/atomic/, and full Eastic snapshots for Hyperion https://backup.wecan.dev/wax/hyperion/ which can be used to spin up full WAX Mainnet and Testnet infrastructure in up to 2 weeks instead of months. And it's all free of charge.
Our weekly stats demonstrate good usage numbers and we hope that we can make it even better:
![twitter](https://github.com/We-Can-dev/waxguilds/blob/july-2022/reports/bp.wecan/images/wecan_image8.png)

As it was during the last evaluation period we've checked all publicly available WAX snapshot services to have a ground for our claims that we have the most recent snapshots out of all providers (which is something that we should work on as WAX community to provide better bandwidth and more independent sources and regions):

The Ambassadors for R-Planet programme

The Ambassadors program for R-Planet was introduced on April 1 (https://rplanet.medium.com/welcome-to-the-r-planet-ambassadors-club-55e520a32e57).
R-Planet defined ambassadors of the last month (https://twitter.com/RPLANETio/status/1532300006367105029?s=20&t=Fjc4L4CV8sdnaW8dW5QQHw).  
This program has been arranged to stimulate projects listed within the R-Planet Staking Hub to promote R-Planet and the whole wax ecosystem in various ways.
Such as publication within social media, different cross-project cooperation, NFT blends, development of useful tools, etc.

New project Exit Limbo has been added to the Staking Hub https://twitter.com/RPLANETio/status/1537386047339958274?s=20&t=Fjc4L4CV8sdnaW8dW5QQHw.
Every project listed on the R-Planet brings its users to R-Planet, making them a part of our community and a part of the WAX community as well.
