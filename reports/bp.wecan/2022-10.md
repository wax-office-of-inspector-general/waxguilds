Our team helped to implement and release separate functionality called Blender and TechAsics farms.
Blender allows to combine multiple NFTs and get better NFTs with better hash rate. This was designed to get rid of the old NFTs and release pressure on blockchain.
TechAsics is a functionality that allows stacking multiple Asic NFTs to increase the accounts hash rate.
Overall this boosted interest to the game and it can boast good volume on most popular WAX NFT platforms for over 4 months already.
