This type of server is available for everyone.
It doesn’t have NFT prizes, but all other features (like NFT usage, attacking, spying, robbery) are available.

There were localization of Spanish and Ukrainian languages, writing next server configuration and game rules, adding categories for mobile notifications, implementing heroes and alliance functionality, implementing player scores by combat, implementing combat calculator, creating inventory page, implementing in-game messaging, implementing event filtering, implementing push notification UI etc.
