Almost 700 hundred players actively took part in it. They wrote a lot of feedback, they performed  248 361 combats, and implemented into the game almost 2 millions robots from NFTs (more stats from the first Alpha are available here https://rplanet.medium.com/r-planet-conquest-closed-alpha-in-figures-and-facts-d185e1e4a1b2).
