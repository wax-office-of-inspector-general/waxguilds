## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Operations: We had a couple of internal issues with public infrastructure when two of our history nodes were left out of sync, but thankfully the third history node was able to maintain the load and we barely seen any issues with our public hyperion api.
Also two backend servers for public mainnet wax chain api went offline for unplanned maintenance, but thanks to our redundancy we kept providing chain api without any issues.

WIP: we keep working on proxy optimisations for our public infrastructure and right now we're in stage of testing new healthchecks which should improve reliability.

Successfully keeping up with all the technical requirements from https://wax-oig.notion.site/v4-7-Office-of-Inspector-General-Guidelines-DRAFT-e381a02b97554971b90dfb0950c1dd41

We’ve been closely working with the community and players, who write us a lot of feedback from the playground server. All tickets from them are processed within the  https://desk.zoho.eu/ system.

Also, our moderators from different time zones answer the questions and help the players in the Discord and Telegram chats.

We’ve summarized the previous year, announced the Roadmap for 2023, and revealed the date of the Open Alpha launch in the article on Medium.
(https://rplanet.medium.com/r-planet-essential-events-of-2022-and-plans-for-2023-and-beyond-4087f9ce2fe8).

We’ve been preparing a campaign to engage players from the general gaming community and gradually immerse them in crypto and NFTs. Firstly we will broadcast this article, Experience the Thrills of the new R-Planet Strategy Game, in media that cover the mobile gaming sphere.

Also, we developed the strategy for our new Instagram page (https://www.instagram.com/rplanetio/), which we are going to target newbies. It should have educational content in a light format to help newcomers understand our game.

### R-Planet MMO Strategy game (Early Access Alpha)
* Status: **in development**
Website:
https://rplanet.app/

App:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.wecan.rplanet
https://apps.apple.com/es/app/r-planet/id1625678981


We’ve been developing new features for the R-Planet App which will be available in Alpha2. This server is scheduled to launch on January 27.

One of the new key features will be alliances. Each alliance will have its name, description, and color. The maximum number of players in any single alliance is 50. Alliance management is carried out through hierarchies of roles аssigned to its members, such as an owner, admins, and players. Every role determines the rights and obligations of its carrier. Players will have access to the internal alliance messenger with the possibility of separate chat creation. Also, players will be able to use chat to share battle reports and screenshots of their bases.
Developers are also working on the combat calculator, in-game chat, hero functionality, and implementing new types of assets.

### Pepper Stake
* Status: **in development**
* Website:
 - https://pepperstake.online/
 - https://testnet.pepperstake.online/


**Description of the project.**
Pepper Stake is a new service for the effortless creation of staking utilities within the WAX ecosystem. Using The Pepper Stake, anyone can create a Staking system where users can stake NFTs or a token or NFTs and a token created on the WAX blockchain and be rewarded.

**Technical specialties.**
The staking system is fully decentralized, so anyone is able to use its own UI or/and use any WAX explorer to communicate directly with the smart contract of Pepper Stake. No centralized services are used to make the system work.

This project gives a lot of benefits for users. They will be able to take unneeded NFTs to get some profit, explore the WAX ecosystem to be the first one to learn about new promising projects on WAX, choose prospective projects and get their token as a reward for staking.
