The **WAX Mainnet Antelope upgrade** so far:
We're about 20% done with plans to finish the upgrade in a couple of coming days (March 5 - deadline).
The upgrade of BP and failover BP has been completed and the Chain API nodes are half upgraded - we did only failover boxes for now.
Then ship nodes and backup servers that are at the end of the list.

Operations:
We took active part in WAX incident resolution that happened last week on Feb 20.
Right at that time there were implemented BP peering improvements and subsequent upgrade to Antelope

Also during this period we had a couple of short spanning issues with our public IPFS gateway caching.
The overall partial availability was about 3 hours https://status.wecan.dev/790677499 .
We had to pause the check here in order to stop paging us since the monitoring wasn't reading the status correctly due to stale cache.

We also keep supporting and actively using the latest wax codebase in a containerized manner https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/wecandev/waxblockchain/tags?page_size=1024

During this time we implemented and released new features:

Limit of Robot NFT activating (the number of Robot NFTs that users can inject daily is strictly limited by the level of the Nexus on the player’s base).
The functionality of alliances (it allows every player to form or join a union of a maximum of 50 people and provides tools to manage it).
Combat calculator (it allows the player to forecast the results of a battle by entering all of their army’s data and the data of their enemies’ armies).
New types of assets (such as mineral injections, Finish Now, 24hr Protection Dome, and Extra Slots).
In-game chat with emojis.
The German, Spanish and Ukrainian language.
Map view for max zoom.
Limited time for sending resources (it makes the resource management process more efficient and allows players to set a maximum time for sending resources when they create orders in the Market).

Improved alliance pages (alliance pages were reorganized to improve the navigation).
Easy switching between bases.
Buttons to copy location IDs and messages.

Appearance of base depends on the amount of droids (the appearance of the player's base on the map is modified to reflect its development and the number of droids serving there).

Also, new NFTs of the Hero were issued and sent to the winners of Closed Alpha (Alpha1 server). These NFTs can be entered into the game and it replaces the main avatar of the player. The functionality of the Hero will be developed and added gradually.
