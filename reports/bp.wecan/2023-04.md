## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We came close to our hardware capacity limit in WAX public infrastructure, so we've planned a gradual upgrade that we started executing a week ago.
Currently we're working on large hardware upgrade for Mainnet Hyperion API, Chain APIs, IPFS gateway and P2P nodes.
It's planned to be completed by the next evaluation date.

We are pleased to provide you with an update on the development of R-Planet game. We are working diligently to bring new and exciting features to the game in our upcoming update.

One of the features we are currently implementing is the ability to track and manage the health of heroes in the game. This feature will add an additional layer of strategy for players, as they will need to manage their hero's health in order to progress through the game.

Another key feature we are working on is the ability to relocate heroes with their bases. This will allow players to move their heroes and bases to more strategic locations on the game map, enabling them to gain an advantage over their opponents.

We are also implementing a new set of parameters for hero bases, such as speed, force, unit attack, unit defense, unit speed, and mine rate. These parameters will provide players with more options for customizing their hero's abilities and strengths.

In addition, we are making improvements to the game map to enhance the overall player experience. One such improvement is the implementation of user inactivity tracking, which will display an inactive state if a user has not logged in for three days. This will enable players to identify and strategize against inactive players.

Also, we are adding a new feature to the game map that will display alliance activity. This will provide players with a better understanding of the alliances in the game and their respective levels of activity.
