## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We successfully upgraded the capacity of our entire public infrastructure.

Hyperion and Chain APIs were migrated to more bulky servers without any interruption of service.
IPFS gateway setup was refactored to improve reciliency and fault tolerance.
P2P nodes were restructured in order to hold the network load more effectively.

Current future proofing should be safely enough for about two years of uninterrupted public WAX services uptime.

* Status: **in development**

https://apps.apple.com/es/app/r-planet/id1625678981

We are pleased to provide you with an update on the development of the R-Planet game. Devs have prepared numerous highly anticipated features and improvements.
 
New Features:

**Hero Main Functionality**
The Hero is capable of transitioning from one base to another. Players can send their Hero into battle alongside the units belonging to the base to which the hero is attached. The hero’s properties, such as health, speed, force (attack and defense), unit attack boost, unit defense boost, mining rate and Masics capacity, have been successfully implemented.

Furthermore, the Hero possesses additional characteristics, namely experience and level. In the event that the Hero falls in battle, the player has the option to revive the Hero, although this requires both time and resources.

Grouping Combat Events in the Activity Tab

In response to player feedback regarding the lengthy list of events during battles, we have implemented grouping combat events in the Activity Tab.

**Base Relocation**

In this latest update, players now have the ability to relocate their initial base once during the game, provided they have not yet acquired another base.

**Cancellation of Operations**

In this version, users now have the ability to recall their units even after they have already departed from the base. To initiate the recall, users must press the “Return” button within a limited timeframe following the departure of the units from the base.

Bug Fixes and Improvements: Messenger Font Color, Combat Calculator and Inappropriate Units, Battle Report Display Issue, Missing “Back” Button after Sharing Combat Report.
