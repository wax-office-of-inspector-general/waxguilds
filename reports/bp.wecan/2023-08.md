What has been done:

1. Migration of Main BP node to a new hardware after we found that we missed 1 round
https://www.alohaeos.com/tools/reliability#networkId=11&timeframeId=8

due to the network link issue:

```

```
2. Migrated most of our infra to the latest NodeOS v4.0.4 which includes hotfix and other improvements.

We are pleased to provide you with an update on the development of the R-Planet game. Devs have been working on numerous features and improvements.
 
*Onboarding tasks*

Onboarding tasks is a list of tasks that, upon completion, will reward the user with certain resources. These tasks cover various game activities that players can fulfill during their gameplay. 

*Hero Quest*

If the hero has a quest point, he can embark on a quest. The hero can bring back some useful assets from their trips; however, in every quest, the hero loses some health.

*In-Game Unpacking*

With the in-game unpacking feature, users will have the ability to open boxes containing assets directly within the game. It doesn’t matter whether these boxes were purchased, won, or found during the hero’s quests. The assets can be classified into two types:

Withdrawable Assets (NFT assets):
Currently, all assets are withdrawable NFTs until they are activated in the game. Users can deposit them within the game or withdraw them to the chain from which they were originally deposited, at any time they desire.

Non-Withdrawable Assets (in-game assets):
These assets can only be used within the server where they were obtained. They cannot be withdrawn or transferred to other chains or platforms.


1. Moderator Interviews

We conducted and published interviews with the moderators of R-Planet, providing players with exclusive insights into their experiences, gaming strategies, and the enthusiasm propelling the game's future.
