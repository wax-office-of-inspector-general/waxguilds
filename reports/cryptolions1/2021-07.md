#.-Kolobok
 - Kolobok continues to be a top-10 Blockchain game, currently ranked at #9
https://dappradar.com/wax/games/kolobok-adventures  
                       * Kolobok users have decreased by from 30.62k to 19.29k from the previous report but                                                 shows increase in the average amount of transaction per person 
                     (4390000/30620=143 as in previous report Vs. 4090000/19290=212 in this report)
Took RAM Optimization measures. This was a follow up step to improve resource optimization following last month's development of creating the Kolobok back end to reduce CPU consumption.      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Continued work on the new “ Beauty Contest ‘ -section of the game launched last month 
http://bit.ly/kolobok_beauty_contest
This is the first step to the in-game NFTs/players interaction and one step forward to more utility for KBUCKS. To join the totally fair Beauty Contest choose your kolobok and your own entrance fee in KBUCKS. The amount you paid is the initial score your kolobok gets. We maintain a list of the top 20. Scores decrease 10% every day. The winner who holds first place for 24 hours gets 100 KBACKS and records to mdata. In a month, we'll also launch Beauty Contest on EOS and TELOS.
