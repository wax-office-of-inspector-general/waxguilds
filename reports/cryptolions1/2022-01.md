### Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

##1)  Our community manager Bonz volunteered to work at the WAX booths at both the Miami NFT Basil event and the DecentralCon NFT event. A volunteer was needed to open the event and set up the table at NFT Basil at 7am. Bonz took on this responsibility and set up the table using the WAX shirts as branding, and worked throughout the day educating folks and promoting WAX until the event ended. ( including cleaning up and bringing the remaining shirts to the event the following day.)  Both events were a great success in terms of marketing and  educating the attendees about the benefits of building on WAX, onboarding new users and increasing the general awareness of the WAX blockchain and ecosystem. 

## 2). We have one team member dedicated to engaging the community in the Chinese market, - 
1). Promote WAX.io in the Chinese community and make Q&A for WAX newcomers, including how to apply for an account and purchase WAXP etc., and answer or help users’ questions 
2). Share WAX news and some game project news in the Chinese community
3).conducting AMA’s with Chinese community 
4). educating them on the WAX ecosystem and products 

##3)  We continue to support and grow all of our community channels :

##5) 2 representatives from our team have joined the EOS Bees initiative, to gain knowledge and experience with this approach in blockchain marketing using social media to engage new users . If this approach has success, our team’s experience could help use a similar approach on the WAX blockchain. They are leading Ukrainian and China departments of EOS Bees.
