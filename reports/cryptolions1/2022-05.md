#1)Kolobok 2.0  status: in development 
updates on milestones
— on May 3rd — the monthly bounty was replenished with new requirements https://t.me/kolobok_io/50

— on May 16th — the Main Pack Sale and Pack opening were launched on WAX Mainnet. We don't see sales on the official webpage — but it's expected because the price is higher than it was on pre-sale. People started to buy K2 packs from the secondary market from people who bought packs earlier. Many K2 packs were opened and we see a positive reaction on K2 Collectibles and other K2 NFTs. People are waiting for the Anvil functionality and for the new gameplay. In connection with this event the Mainpage was updated too: https://wax.kolobok.io/?hl=en (blocks with the Most Beautiful Koloboks, the Top KoloPlayers, and "Friends and Partners" were added, the logo with "Kolobok 2.0" were changed to "Kolobok Adventures K2" according to how we call this version in K2 Packs) 

— during April-May we prepared a https://gear.kolobok.io/ with an initial amount of Kolobok merch. We started to test it. It was not officially announced. At the moment there possible to make purchases for fiat (EUR). After all gameplay, we are going to build discount functionality for Gear NFTs which people can find in K2 Packs. While it's less priority — need to build new functionality first and re-write the frontend.

— during April-May we redesigned some parts of old and new gameplay. And we already started to build a frontend around Anvil smart-contract which we developed earlier. The current situation with the frontend can be found on the dev-environment: https://dev.play.kolobok.io/workshop/staked-anvils, https://dev.play.kolobok.io/my-anvils, https://dev.play.kolobok.io/my-prizes. Design in Figma of new screens can be shown on request (send dm to https://t.me/ArtemCryptoLions in case of interest). 

— in May we began a partnership with a community built project/ new game on WAX and made a staking pool for kolobok prizes, we allow him to advertise his project in our community https://t.me/ilovekolobok/61383 and continue our communication regarding the kolobok staking pool and potential cooperation in the future

— during that time were provided support and communication with the community, in all communication we continue to emphasize that Kolobok version "K2" and K2 packs are "exclusively on WAX"
