## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

#1) Kolobok 2.0  status: in development 

Updates on milestones:
— since the last report we have continued to develop a great new user interface (https://www.figma.com/file/yNqXLOb0vRZuduNKFzRel0/Kolobok-K2?node-id=0%3A1) and rewrite/migrate the K2 frontend from Angular to ReactJS, and you can see the current results in Test Environment by the link https://dev.play.kolobok.io/koloboks (or see screenshot https://i.gyazo.com/d04ee3d6579a3a013e5290f76270a474.png). Let us know if you need test assets to check it (contact person https://t.me/ArtemCryptoLions), because we were wondering why the Anvil 1.0 update only scored 2 points in the previous report.
— also during the report period, we made work on planning (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nd0xBUVJqfq25agRzoWWzFRqjNYOuQqB7SVbShBcD2c/edit#heading=h.8o5k7fjn2bff) and designing UI/UX of 2 Extra Adventures with the Black Knight and the Dragon (https://www.figma.com/file/yNqXLOb0vRZuduNKFzRel0/Kolobok-K2?node-id=1273%3A2380).
— we started to plan UI/UX for the K2 Circular Economy and for Valhalla (find in the provided Figma files), while because we don't see enough official sales of K2 packs potentially this functional will be delayed https://k2packs.kolobok.io/ and we informed about this moment Kolobok Community https://t.me/ilovekolobok/62280 , https://t.me/ilovekolobok/62367. 
— as usual we have been providing support to Kolobok Community during the report period and launched monthly bounty on August 1st.
— minor fixes of the existing functional on Angular frontend.

Milestones for the next 2 evaluations (next 3 months):
— launch the great new user interface and support community during this migration
— develop smart-contract and frontend for 2 new Extra Adventures
— maybe something else, if enough official K2 sales via https://k2packs.kolobok.io/
