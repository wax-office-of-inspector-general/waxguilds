## Pre-Evaluation Form Responses

### Please provide some information regarding when and how your Guild got involved with the EOSIO or WAX ecosystem. Links to resources are helpful.

Actively involved in EOSIO since before mainnet launch. See update histories here ([https://steemit.com/@cryptolions/feed](https://steemit.com/@cryptolions/feed)) and here ([https://medium.com/@cryptolions](https://medium.com/@cryptolions)). We are arguably best known for the Jungle Testnet, and the Simple Assets NFT standard which was adopted as the default standard by WAX ([https://wax.io/blog/buildonwax-wax-will-use-the-simple-assets-nft-standard](https://wax.io/blog/buildonwax-wax-will-use-the-simple-assets-nft-standard)).

### Has anyone in the Guild previously produced blocks on an EOSIO or DPOS network in the past? If so, which ones and what nodes did they help operate?

Yes. Cryptolions (usually `cryptolions1`) has produced blocks on the EOSIO mainnet, Meetone, Jungle, WAX, LYNX testnet, Europechain.We've also been standby BPs on Telos and BOS.

It was released this month (November).We are working on an improved version of kolobok ([kolobok.io](http://kolobok.io/)) called "Kolobok Adventures", and will launch exclusively on WAX for a few months.

Typeform is very cool. Much nicer than google-generated forms.The canary and live-video inspection of our servers are interesting ideas. We'd never heard of them before.
