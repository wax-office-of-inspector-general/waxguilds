We have updated simpledistributions.io to include the TLM token.  We will be using the app to incentivize ongoing payments to Alien Worlds participants. 

We are working to implement the TelosIBC to replace the BOSIBC to bring KROWN tokens back to the WAX chain.  This will include a claim site to retrieve the stranded WAX based tokens left in the broken BOS IBC contract.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

1) We are excited that we were successful in bringing a new community over to WAX.

It is the Safemoon community: https://safemoon.net/
They are a BSC community, and after our discussions with them at the Bitcoin conference https://www.expcrypto.io/ in Miami April 20-23, we showed them the functionality of WAX, and showed them a path to wrap their tokens to connect their chain to WAX.

We connected them to the pTokens team, and now they have announced their bridge to WAX.

Safemoon has over  2.4 million wallets/users:

They have had over 4.8 billion worth of trade volume since March 9, 2021.

We are excited to engage their user base in the WAX ecosystem, and in WAX based games.

2) We are running a WAX promo, giving away NFTs that reward TLM each day:
