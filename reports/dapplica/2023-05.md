STATS:
Created BUY pools: 10    
Created SELL pools: 26
---
Total pools: 36
Unique Collection with pools: 11

- In Plans:
- Launching two side pools in early June, so users can buy and sell at a same time, choosing different bonding curves as well as even earn on those. It needs quite complex pricing logic, fees and bonding curve as well as testing along with early adopters, hearing feebdack.
- Promote it more to collection owners, so they may want to keep floor price for their collection. 
- Design tokenomics incentives ( either pay users in WAX based stake of ALCH on activities or ALCH to ALCH staking rewards to start first ) 
5. New Game in development: Codename RTP. Demo link on testnet will be shared. Game is on pause at the moment for better time to launch, still polishing some stuff.
