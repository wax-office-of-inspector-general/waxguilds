**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**
We have problems over the last few months with high latency in block verification. In order to solve this problem, we optimize our server configuration document and set up more powerful servers. The result has been very good as can be seen in the graph.

After improvement:

After one month running, our server is stable

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**
A. Swap: we have build a swap platform for users. Users can add liquidity to earn transaction fees and mining rewards; they can also buy/sell. We are going to build API and other public support for project teams of WAX to fetch their token price and other info. Alcor focuses more on Book Order Mode. Where you go “Ask” and “Bid”. Sellers offer a price, and buyers accept that price/ vice versa.
Defibox is an automatic market making (AMM). We have “Swap” which is based on Uniswap V2. We build our liquidity for many WAX tokens. In my opinion, it is better than booking orders because there are three major advantages：
1. Swap is realized through smart contracts without manual intervention. 
2. Users can stake tokens for mining and earn transaction fees.
3. The transaction is instant

B.Dual Mining
We provide mining tools that can give liquidity provider rewards with various tokens (WAX, BOX, and project team tokens). In this way, liquidity of trade pair will be easily boosted and this increases TVL level of WAX, thus improve its overall value of WAX chain.
Smart contract that execute dual mining: https://wax.bloks.io/account/lppool.box

C.Real-time Data Chart - Price line, liquidity trend and trade volume bar
Defibox offers real time data chart for tokens. Users can easily see their token price, liquidity trend and trade volume in Defibox. This serves as a standard exchange center for WAX community.

D.Resource renting tools
Defibox provides CPU resource rent service for WAX users easily stake/unstake their WAX for their resource. This resource tool gives WAX users a friendly experience when they encounter the resource requirement during the use of WAX.
