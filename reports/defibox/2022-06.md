we have build a swap platform for users. Users can add liquidity to earn transaction fees and mining rewards; they can also buy/sell and get tokens instantly.

B.Dual Mining
We provide mining tools that can give liquidity provider rewards with various tokens (WAX, BOX, and project team tokens). In this way, liquidity of trade pair will be easily boosted and this increases TVL level of WAX, thus improve its overall value of WAX chain.
