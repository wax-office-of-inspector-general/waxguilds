A.WAX Blindbox System

Defibox 2nd Anniversary event gained lots of reputations and favor from WAX community and WAX fellows love it. This event gives WAX community lots of fun and also many benefits. From feedback of WAX community, we are developing a platform where WAX players can participate some DeFi Game and win rewards on monthly basis. The WAX Blindbox System will be online in September.
Features: WAX players can complete WAX DeFi task, like Swap, adding/reduce liquidity, etc to earn points. Then users can use points to draw blindbox for prize. The task can be customized to suit certain tokens. For example, we can task for WAX-CMW, WAX-LFGK, or WAX-any other project parties tokens so that it is flexible to cooperate with any WAX partner.

B.Swap supported with dual mining, price line, data chart, etc.

we have build a swap platform for users. Users can add liquidity to earn transaction fees and mining rewards; they can also buy/sell and get tokens instantly. We provide mining tools that can give liquidity provider rewards with various tokens (WAX, BOX, and project team tokens). In this way, liquidity of trade pair will be easily boosted and this increases TVL level of WAX, thus improve its overall value of WAX chain. Smart contract that execute dual mining
