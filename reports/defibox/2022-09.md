https://t.me/DefiboxCN

Defibox helps a lot in attracting Chinese community to WAX chain with the help of our Blindbox game. New users are new to WAX and there is little Chinese information about WAX. We set up a 10+ Chinese volunteers （WAX中文志愿者）to help those who want to know more about WAX. In July, we helped at least 100+ Chinese people who were new to WAX during this month.
