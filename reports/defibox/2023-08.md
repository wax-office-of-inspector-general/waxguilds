WAX Blindbox System
https://wax.defibox.io/scoreShop
The WAX Blindbox System was online in September. It is a platform where WAX players can participate some DeFi Game and win rewards on monthly basis. This game gives WAX community lots of fun and also many benefits. WAX players can complete WAX DeFi task, like Swap, adding/reduce liquidity, etc to earn points. Then users can use points to draw blindbox for prize. The task can be customized to suit certain tokens. For example, we can task for WAX-CMW, WAX-LOOT, or WAX-any other project parties tokens so that it is flexible to cooperate with any WAX partner.
On October, we gave away an iPhone 13 Pro and other tokens. WAX community love it! For 2023 March, we are preparing a mystic prize, just wait and see. For now, it is still available to draw some token prize from our WAX Blindbox system.

Swap supported with dual mining, price line, data chart, etc.
https://wax.defibox.io/
we have build a swap platform for users. Users can add liquidity to earn transaction fees and mining rewards; they can also buy/sell and get tokens instantly. We provide mining tools that can give liquidity provider rewards with various tokens (WAX, BOX, and project team tokens). In this way, liquidity of trade pair will be easily boosted and this increases TVL level of WAX, thus improve its overall value of WAX chain. Smart contract that execute dual mining.

https://t.me/DefiboxCN


Defibox helps a lot in attracting Chinese community to WAX chain with the help of our Blindbox game. New users are new to WAX and there is little Chinese information about WAX. We set up a 10+ Chinese volunteers （WAX中文志愿者）to help those who want to know more about WAX. However, it is the bear market now, users are not that active any more, the Chinese WAX community volunteer team answered 30+ questions for Chinese people who were new to WAX during this month (on average one question per day).
