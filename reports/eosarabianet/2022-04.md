- We have upgraded our wax mainnet hyperion infra to cover 3 ship nodes with 2 hyperion nodes.

- We have added History V1+V2 on Wax testnet chain:
https://api-testnet-wax.eosarabia.net/v2/health
https://validate.eosnation.io/waxtest/producers/eosarabianet.html

- We are happy to accept more than 50 requests per second on our Hyperion infra.
  The following links contain the stress test for 3 different kinds of requests:
