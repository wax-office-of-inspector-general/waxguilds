We have tried as much as we can to help with the lateat issue that has been occured to wax mainnet and enabled the greylist to nodes' config.

- we support mainnet and testnet will full history API's.
- We still support the wax mainnet and wax testnet with history API (v1+v2).
- We still support the wax mainnet AA API.


- We are happy to accept more than 50 requests per second on our Hyperion infra.
  The following links contain the stress test for 3 different kinds of requests:

The good thing the response time is stable.
