- All nodes (Testnet,Mainnet) are running leap versions 3.1.* and 3.2.*.
- we still support mainnet and testnet with a full history + Hyperion API's (v1+v2).
- We still support the wax mainnet AA API.


- We are happy to accept more than 50 requests per second on our Hyperion infra.
  The following links contain the stress test for 3 different kinds of requests:

The good thing the response time is stable.


- Our peer node now accepts 200 peers instead of 188 and the connections are around 180-189.
