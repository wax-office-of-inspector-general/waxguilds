### 1. Hyperion & V1 history
 - We now have an additional hyperion & v1 history server that is fully synced hyperion and serving traffic on http://api-wax.eosauthority.com/v2/health 
 - The V1 full history access end point is also used with the new server http://api-wax.eosauthority.com/v1/chain/get_info
 - The additional servers will help with load balancing & fail over.

### 2. Atomic Assets
A backup server for Atomic assets API is now synced and serving traffic http://aa-api-wax.eosauthority.com/health

### 3. Nodeos version update
We upgraded all WAX servers to v2.0.13wax01 after testing on different internal wax nodes. EOS Authority has an 100% block production uptime in this month as of writing this report.

### Service Limits

NOTE: The load balancers do not take requests from IPs for 4 hours when they send over 200 error requests in 5 minutes. The rates below are subject to change as we get quite a lot of traffic. 

**API Nodes** 

Traffic is load balanced to multiple API servers. Per unique IP request limit (1000 requests per 60sec interval). IP that exceeds this will be rate limited for 10 minutes and then allowed to request.

**Hyperion API**

Traffic is load balanced to two hyperion servers. Per unique IP request limit (300 requests per 60sec interval). IP that exceeds this will be rate limited for 5 minutes and then allowed to request.

**Atomic API**

Traffic is load balanced to two Atomic assets servers. Per unique IP request limit (300 requests per 60sec interval). IP that exceeds this will be rate limited for 5 minutes and then allowed to request.
