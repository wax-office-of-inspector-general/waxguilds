### Service Limits

NOTE: The load balancers do not take requests from IPs for 4 hours when they send over 200 error requests in 5 minutes. The rates below are subject to change as we get quite a lot of traffic. 

**API Nodes** 

Traffic is load balanced to multiple API servers. Per unique IP request limit (1000 requests per 60sec interval). IP that exceeds this will be rate limited for 10 minutes and then allowed to request.

**Hyperion API**

Traffic is load balanced to two hyperion servers. Per unique IP request limit (300 requests per 60sec interval). IP that exceeds this will be rate limited for 5 minutes and then allowed to request.

**Atomic API**

Traffic is load balanced to two Atomic assets servers. Per unique IP request limit (300 requests per 60sec interval). IP that exceeds this will be rate limited for 5 minutes and then allowed to request.

WAX Forensics is new product which helps user track the flow of tokens between any WAX account. WAX token is supported and we are adding more tokens to the list as data collection is completed.
