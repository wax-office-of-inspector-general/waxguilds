**Introducing free transactions**

Free transactions are now live for WAX users on the EOS Authority website. The WAX wallet on the EOS Authority website now allows free transactions for accounts that have run out of CPU / NET. The wallet utilises the first signer option provided by EOSIO and pays for resources on behalf of the users. The free transaction works for both WAX cloud wallet accounts and normal WAX accounts. Users just have to use the explorer and create the transaction and this will be signed by the wallet to avoid users having to pay for resources. This product is in BETA now and we have invisible reCAPTCHA and most users will not be asked to solve them. We will continue monitoring this service and increasing stake over the coming weeks to help users transact on WAX. 

How to use: Visit https://eosauthority.com/?network=wax search and add account. Then sign with cloud wallet or other wallet options. 

**Project summary as requested on 15th Nov in Network Governance telegram chat**

Name of the project: WAX realtime Telegram bot \
URL: https://t.me/waxauthoritybot \
Users (with metrics): Over 2,500 user accounts monitored with the bot realtime alerts service. \
What have you done in the last 4 weeks: We recently updated the server and all alerts are being sent out on average of 0.5 seconds of being broadcast to the WAX chain.
Next milestones: We are working to add NFT images within the telegram message and alerts on atomic assets transactions. Looking at adding alerts when Atomic assets have a particular listing or status of bids.

Name of the project: WAX Block explorer & wallet \
URL: https://eosauthority.com/?network=wax \
Users (with metrics): Average over 20,000 unique users per month. \
What have you done in the last 4 weeks: We have rolled out free transactions for all users on the system. This free transactions system should help users stake resources and perform actions when they do not have resources left in their account. The new first signer resource payer model even works for accounts using the WAX cloud wallet.
Next milestones: In the short term, we are looking at improving this new signing model and improving the product for users.

Name of the project: WAX Forensics \
URL: https://eosauthority.com/account/eosauthority?network=wax#forensics (Please scroll down to Forensics (beta) on the page) \
Users (with metrics): Over 4,000 unique users have clicked on and interacted with the WAX Forensics system since launch last month. \
What have you done in the last 4 weeks: This product was just rolled out last month and we are adding additional servers to provide a quick summary of all transactions.
Next milestones: Currently we cover WAX token and are looking to add many more tokens to the list. Adding each token requires us to run an indexer to keep the latest state of the tokens for each user. Users have also suggested full screen which we are looking at setting up.

Name of the project: Carbon neutral WAX blockchain \
URL: https://on.wax.io/co2/ \
Project summary: \
We helped WAX become carbon neutral by offsetting the CO2 emissions of the entire blockchain. We will continue to work with the WAX team annually to keep the blockchain carbon neutral and offset CO2 emissions. This project was picked up by various crypto news websites and continues to provide postive PR for WAX.
