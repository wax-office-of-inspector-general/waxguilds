### Service Limits

NOTE: The load balancers do not take requests from IPs for 4 hours when they send over 200 error requests in 5 minutes. The rates below are subject to change as we get quite a lot of traffic. We have noticed a spike in requests from the same datacenter / ASN. To avoid high use from one entity using the same datacenter, we have added a limit of 10,000 requests / 60s from the same ASN.

**API Nodes** 

Traffic is load balanced to multiple API servers. Per unique IP request limit (1000 requests per 60sec interval). IP that exceeds this will be rate limited for 10 minutes and then allowed to request.

**Hyperion API**

Traffic is load balanced to two hyperion servers. Per unique IP request limit (300 requests per 60sec interval). IP that exceeds this will be rate limited for 5 minutes and then allowed to request.

**Atomic API**

Traffic is load balanced to two Atomic assets servers. Per unique IP request limit (300 requests per 60sec interval). IP that exceeds this will be rate limited for 5 minutes and then allowed to request.
