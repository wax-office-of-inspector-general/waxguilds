1) We have setup delphioracle writer for the eosauthority account [https://eosauthority.com/account/eosauthority?network=wax](https://eosauthority.com/account/eosauthority?network=wax)

2) EOS Authority has helped offset WAX carbon emissions for 1 year making WAX carbon netural for block production. You can read more about it on [https://on.wax.io/co2/](https://on.wax.io/co2/) EOS Authority organized the calculations and paid ClimateCare offset onbelhalf of WAX blockchain.

We are working on a realtime telegram alert bot as a free service for all WAX accounts. We hope to update and announce in a few more weeks after testing. Will write about this in more detail at next month's submission.
