Product 1: confidential

Product 2: Ethereum bridge mechanism

We continue to use the Ethereum bridge and the fact that it is out there and working strengthens the notion, which the WAX chain as a whole is trying to advance, that WAX is a great layer two solution to ETH (where the liquidity is).

As a reminder, Michael Yeates developed the only method for allowing a WAX token to be dual-listed on Ethereum, dramatically increasing reach.

**Open source code**: [https://github.com/michaeljyeates/alienteleport](https://github.com/michaeljyeates/alienteleport)

**Development stage**: released, live and functioning, transactions have been made using this functionality

On WAX: [https://wax-test.bloks.io/account/other.world](https://wax-test.bloks.io/account/other.world)

On ETH (counterpart contract): https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x2A638bB2CE656f13f93d83486a964E215B50263B

**Significance**: highly significant piece of new engineering for WAX and will allow WAX based tokens to be dual listed on ETH. If you would like more detail about the tech itself you can refer here

## January 2021

Our update for this month:

Product: the continued growth of the Alien Worlds metaverse which is now the largest dapp on WAX by user numbers (and 7th biggest dapp across any chain or category) per Dapp radar).

As in previous months, use of the cross chain ETH/WAX functionality built by Michael Yeates is allowing a WAX layer 2 product to use the ethereum chain for storage and liquidity.

(Update only submitted, previously outlined product areas still apply)

Community:

Continued promotion of WAX cloud wallet and WAX as layer two in about 15 AMAs to date ([https://alienworlds.io/calendar](https://alienworlds.io/calendar)) to global audience of about 25k. See also AMA section of our website [alienworlds.io](http://alienworlds.io/).

Our telegram channel is now over 3k many of whom have been onboarded from outside of existing WAX ecosystem. Discord over 1k, WeChat nearing 500, a Russian language Telegram about 150.

Comment: resubmitted – no deal as per WAX

1. Ecosystem development 2: Ethereum Ambassador programme

In November we progressed a collaboration with Dapp-craft who will create a scene within Decentraland educating users on creating a WAX cloud wallet and, after they do this, tying this up with their Decentraland identity to allow the user to claim a WAX-based NFT

We expect to have this functionality live by mid December, which will be a significant step forward for WAX traction within Decentraland.

## Hotbit - WAX listing

**Qualified deal; WAX moving forward to provide liquidity**

We continue to keep this opportunity warm throughout October as WAX arranges to provide the necessary liquidity for listing.

We have arranged for listing on Hotbit. The status is complete pending WAX to provide requested liquidity.

**Background**: Hotbit is one of the top 50 digital currency exchange by volume that offers a wide range of supported digital assets with over 500 trading pairs. Launched in 2018 and is registered in Estonia and Hongkong and has a multicultural team from China, USA and Taiwan.

The team behind Hotbit are veterans from the Bitcoin and Ethereum mining scene in China. According to their website, Hotbit has partnerships with F2Pool, Spark Pool, Slow Mist and HashQuark. Hotbit exists as a web-based platform available on all devices and is localized in six languages including English, Russian, Chinese, Korean, Thai and Turkish and offers 24/7 customer support. In addition to spot trading of digital, Hotbit also offers products like ETFs, an OTC desk, Cloud mining services and IEOs. Hotbit operates in a multinodular structure which meets the requirements set by the IT surveillance logical structure from the Financial Industry point of view, ensuring steady operations and highest level of security. Overall, Hotbit has established itself as a secured and trusted Tier 2 exchange that has decent liquidity for all the hot crypto assets and welcomes most new and promising projects to get listed on their exchange with minimal requirements.

In our chat with one of the listing managers at Hotbit, who is our very good contact from EOSDAC listing days, we have been offered to get a WAX/USDT trading pair with a bare minimum requirement of providing liquidity for market making for a minimum of 5000 USDT worth of WAX tokens and 5000 USDT. WAX tokens and 5000 USDT can be in the user account on Hotbit exchange that will do the initial market making. We will be happy to get a formal discussion started over emails to introduce the WAX team with our friends at Hotbit to discuss further requirements. Updated status is we are keeping the deal warm by email pending WAX taking over the line.

## Ecosystem development 2: Ethereum Ambassador programme (names of Ambassadors confidential)

We have launched a programme to reach out to Gods Unchained, Rari, Decentraland, Axie, wand other ETH communities.

https://alienworlds.medium.com/free-alien-worlds-nfts-ethereum-promo-drop-from-alien-worlds-ethereum-ambassador-program-3f37271372f1

not yet but we are looking at this

Yes - we suggest deleting "Managing an exchange integration with WAX"In our view there is insufficient room for many candidates to score points on this criteria, so it is not a good metric.
