What is the name of your Guild?
EOS Dublin 

Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
We are running AA API, History and have production-ready infrastructure.

Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?
Yes, across our RedRope and voucher products we have made significant progress on the front end and backend - See the RedRope website here. Our content team will be updating the project over the coming week With dMerch we are re-structuring the project delivery strategy and will be providing consulting services to upcoming projects and games on WAX. 

RED ROPE: NFT Memories - We have onboarded another partner to distribute NFTs to event attendees. We have created a batch NFT creation script (closed source, for now, we plan to open-source this in Q3 2022 once we have completed several stages of development). Our business development lead (Adam) has continued to actively seek events and partnerships to distribute Red Rope NFTs to attendees. 
We have continued working with Whelans Dublin and SOMA to create NFTs that will be given to people who attend the event. Late-night events in Ireland will recommence from Feb 2022 and we will be running our partner events once the curfew is lifted.  
Gift Vouchers: Our front end is now on our staging server - The demo is available and QA and unit testing has been commenced. We will now move to the WAX integration phase to allow the creation of gift cards using AA and the ability to list on secondary markets. This will be conducted in sprints with the monthly updates being sent to the guild. This will add a lot of value to WAX as any collection or community member can create and sell gift vouchers that are designed for the ‘tech illiterate’ - Therefore increasing the adoption potential for WAX. 

WAX.School: Is being moved from a Product to being a public good initiative funded by eosDublin. Course attendance has dropped and we are getting a lot more interaction with our videos and blogs. The WAX school will become an aggregated list value add community content with the ability to post and seek new opportunities and team members to further your project.

Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
Yes, we are happy to report that we have made significant progress working with Defactor.com on bringing NFT financing to WAX - We have completed several stages of smart contract development and will have the POC available for unit testing in Feb 2022. 

The purpose of this collaboration is to: 
Provide enhanced functionality to the wax community 
Prove that WAX is a stable and robust environment to attract more defi and gamefi projects to the ecosystem
Give buyers who missed out on lower primary market sales an opportunity to get NFTs at a discounted price
Please see the specifications and work completed to date for the Defactor / WAX POC in the confidential document 


Upon completion a ‘user’ will be able to lock up their NFTs and receive a time-based loan of WAXp - Upon successful repayment, the NFTs are returned. If not they are offered for sale at a massive discount. 

Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
Yes, Isaac from eosDublin has begun a new video campaign and will be releasing regular updates. We will be releasing these videos on a weekly basis and hosting them on WAX school (See strategy above)
