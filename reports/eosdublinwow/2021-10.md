Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Yes - Over the past few months we have been working on our strategy to add maximum value to the network. We will be investing in a number of key areas such as identity, scalability and also our in-house products and tools. WAX school continues to pull in good numbers and we will be ramping up the original content so that new community members have a series of comprehensive guides to bring them up to speed. dMerch, RedRope and Gift Vouchers will be the primary foucus of our core team for the coming months. 

## WAX School: We have added to our team at WAX school and have given the go-ahead for research and creation of 4 new pieces of original content per month. The goal is to continue educating new and existing members of the community with micro learning assets such as how to guildes, video reviews, project highlights etc.

##Â dMerch: The dmerch.io business unit has mainly been focused on services has been continuing to onboard new IP and collections which will be coming to WAX. On the tooling side, we have began development of a solution for our brands to sell their NFTs from their own SECOND MARKET shopfront - This will allow the hosting and sale of digital and physical merchandise in a branded mini-site with a simple UI. More detailed product information sent in the confidential email sent to the IGs.    

## RED ROPE: NFT Memories - We have made a lot of progress with our Red Rope project. As events and venues are re-opeining in Irleand and the UK, we will be releasing our RED ROPE tool for free to the community. Any venue, event or show can create an 'event', fans can send their used tickets to RED ROPE and will receive a commemorative NFT for the event. eosDublin will be covering the resource cost of minting the assets for the venues. We will be doing a number of showcase events to demonstrate the simple platform. This is the first step of a three phase road map which we will be working towards throughout 2022. 

# Gift Vouchers: eosDublin is also the owner of a gift voucher tool - www.giftvoucher.online that has hundreds of businesses signed up with some very prominent restaurants around Ireland using the service. We have started a comprehensive upgrade of the system and are proud to announce that we will be bringing the solution to WAX! One of the key components will be a secondary market function for the vouchers to be re-sold on WAX. This will allow businesses from around the world to create an account and sell their vouchers to customers. Accounts are free with a commission on voucher sales. We will also be offering a 'pay in WAXP' function to the site to allow
