## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We have significantly upgraded our tech infrastructure over the previous months and have maintained production-grade infra since February of this year. We have held off on submitting until we prove that we can maintain continuity of service.  We feel we are ready to submit now and positively contribute to the network. 

Below is a breakdown of our current infrastructure: 

**Steps taken for wax mainnet:**

- Upgraded servers to match resource and performance demand
Provisioned 2 full API/P2P nodes, using stable version => wax-leap v3.2.3wax01
- Nodes are running in parallel, having a loadbalancer in front, for managing the workload and for redundancy
API check https://wax.eosdublin.io/v1/chain/get_info
All blocks are available (earliest available block = 1)
- Provisioned a full Atomic Assets node, using stable version => atomic-assets server 1.3.17
- Node check https://wax-aa.eosdublin.io/health
- All the historic atomic assets data is available for querying, and it's up-to-date
Provisioned a full Hyperion node using stable version => hyperion server 3.3.9-4
- Node check https://wax.eosdublin.io/v2/health
- All the historic data is available for querying, and it's up-to-date
Provisioned a partial SHiP node, which is used by Atomic Assets and Hyperion for continuous
synchronization
- This node is private (only eosdublin uses it for synchronization)
Provisioned 1 Block Producer node, using stable version => wax-leap v3.2.3wax01

**Steps taken for wax testnet:**

- Provisioned 2 partial API/P2P nodes, using stable version => wax-leap v3.2.3wax01
- Nodes are running in parallel, having a loadbalancer in front, for managing the workload and for redundancy. Node check https://wax.testnet.eosdublin.io/v1/chain/get_info

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

No, we will not provide an update here until we have more concrete developments. We are still developing our Identity wallet with [Zaisan.io](http://Zaisan.io) this is a WAX supporting tool which is in pre-launch beta phase. We will provide more information in the coming submissions 

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Yes, we have been working with our business development team on re-engaging with local game studios and artists for collaboration efforts. We have one such game studio / web3 project who are interested in porting its titles over to WAX for release. We will update you in future submissions. 

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

Yes, we have been publishing regular content through our WAX School and EOS Dublin social channels with a combined reach of over 6,000 followers/subscribers.
