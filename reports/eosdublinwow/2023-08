Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We have significantly upgraded our tech infrastructure over the previous months and have maintained production-grade infra since February of this year. We have held off on submitting until we prove that we can maintain continuity of service. We feel we are ready to submit now and positively contribute to the network.

We have also added Delphi Oracle + Hyperion history on the test net.

Below is a breakdown of our current infrastructure:

Steps taken for wax mainnet:

Upgraded servers to match resource and performance demand Provisioned 2 full API/P2P nodes, using stable version => wax-leap v3.2.3wax01
Nodes are running in parallel, having a loadbalancer in front, for managing the workload and for redundancy API check https://wax.eosdublin.io/v1/chain/get_info All blocks are available (earliest available block = 1)
Provisioned a full Atomic Assets node, using stable version => atomic-assets server 1.3.17
Node check https://wax-aa.eosdublin.io/health
All the historic atomic assets data is available for querying, and it's up-to-date Provisioned a full Hyperion node using stable version => hyperion server 3.3.9-4
Node check https://wax.eosdublin.io/v2/health
All the historic data is available for querying, and it's up-to-date Provisioned a partial SHiP node, which is used by Atomic Assets and Hyperion for continuous synchronization
This node is private (only eosdublin uses it for synchronization) Provisioned 1 Block Producer node, using stable version => wax-leap v3.2.3wax01

Steps taken for wax testnet:
Provisioned 2 partial API/P2P nodes, using stable version => wax-leap v3.2.3wax01
Nodes are running in parallel, having a loadbalancer in front, for managing the workload and for redundancy. Node check https://wax.testnet.eosdublin.io/v1/chain/get_info

Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?
No, we will not provide an update here until we have more concrete developments. We are still developing our Identity wallet with Zaisan.io this is a WAX supporting tool which is in pre-launch beta phase. We will provide more information in the coming submissions

We are also working on a new tool for the film / cinema industry which is also to be launched on WAX. More info in future submissions. 

Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
Yes, we have been working with our business development team on re-engaging with local game studios and artists for collaboration efforts. We now have two studios / web3 projects who are interested in porting its titles over to WAX for release. We will update you in future submissions.

Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
Yes, we have been publishing regular content through our WAX School and EOS Dublin social channels with a combined reach of over 6,000 followers/subscribers. Our content has been in the form of Video and Written content providing insight into the ecosystem and giving an overview of the games and projects launching on WAX. As we outlined before, we opt'd to go for regular video and written content as opposed to course content. We have over 800 subscribers and our videos have been getting decent interaction.
