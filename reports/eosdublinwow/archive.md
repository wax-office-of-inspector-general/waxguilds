## **eosDublin Submission**

Hello IGs!,

June was a very busy month, we finally finished contract discussions on a large partnership for the WAX ecosystem which will see some well known  IPs brought to the community. We are in the final stages of the NFTrippy project, Muhammad Ali and another very prolific and well known photographer (in confidential doc). We are nurturing multiple opportunities in the entertainment space, with a very exciting prospect that has a collection tool (off-chain) that we are looking to bring to WAX. More information below.

Our head of entertainment has been working on new partnerships and we are in the final stages of onboarding a very well known C-Level executive in the advisory team for dMerch. We presented WAX at Blockchain Ireland Week and got some interesting prospects that are being pursued.

We are working very hard behind the scenes on major user experience additions and features to be added to WAX, this is being delivered and spec’d in partnership with other leading guilds. We will not add anything further until future submissions.

More information in the confidential document.

WAX on!

**3 - WAX.School**

Significant re-deisign in place to provide further value to the community. We will be focusing on micro-learnings through blogs and videos with a solid base of FAQs, project reviews and community information.

As the WAX ecosystem grows, more people will want easily accessible and digestible information as opposed to registering for and completing a course. We can and have brought a lot of traffic to the site and community videos but we feel like a more sustained investment is needed and this is ongoing from last month.

**2- dMerch**

We have officially closed two client projects this month and will be bringing these NFT projects to WAX

The first project includes never before seen images of Muhammad Ali. Next Steps is to spec the project timeline and pricing model for the NFTs. Project is tentatively scheduled for May with a 4 week media cycle to announce and promote the series. A percentage of the sales will go to support the [BOXING FUTURES](https://boxing-futures.org.uk/) charity in the UK. Boxing Futures supports grassroots boxing and allows disadvantaged youths to get involved in the sport.

**NFTrippy on dMerch**

The second project is based around Psilocybin and Magic Mushrooms. 3 Artists based in Ireland will come together to release a series of collectibles based around magic mushrooms. The artists are working on the theme and draft and are due to submit examples the first week of March for review. Each type of mushroom will be a different character with different rarities being allocated to each. The collectibles will also be ranked by their psilocybin, psilocin, baeocystin content.

Mushrooms being featured:

1. Psilocybe Semilanceata - Liberty Caps
2. Psilocybe Cubensis - Golden Teachers
3. Fly Agaric - Santa Claus Mushrooms
4. Psilocybe - Azurea
5. Panaeolus cyanescens

As well as the closed projects, we have also added 3 new members to the dMerch Advisory team hailing from the music, photography and film industries:

1. Richard Jackson Bass
2. Wendy Laister
3. Christina Jansen

Each of the advisors will be assisting us adding new projects and partners to the dMerch network.

**3- Red Rope**

Following from the successful partnership arrangement with the VI.TO video platform. We will now be showcasing the RedRope site by hosting an end of QT WAX event (Scheduled March 31st).  This event will be free to attend with a maximum of 500 attendees - Commemorative NFTs will be minted and sent to all participants and attendees. This event will be coordinated by eosDublin and Blockleaders and will be the first official event for RedRope as the Egg and VJ projects are on hold for now

**RedRope Ticketing System**

- Tickets will be sold on RedRope, dMerch and the Artists page
- Buyers will receive an email link to access the event
- Buyers can claim their RedRope Ticket
- Buyers can sell and trade tickets up to a defined period before the event
    - 6hrs - 3 days prior to the event
- Buyers will ‘burn’ their ticket and enter their email address (In case it is not the original buyer)
- Once burned the entry will be added to the event guestlist
- Buyers will receive a ‘redeemed’ commemorative NFT for attending the event

The above workflow is tentative and different variations will be tested until the optimal flow is reached. Manual processing will also be included for smaller events.

**4- NIFTYBATTLE**

Let the games begin!

Overview

NIFTYBATTLE (NB) is a new NFT platform under development where players can choose from a variety of cards and play against each other to win collectibles, crypto, and special prizes. NB can be broken down into two parts

1. Nifty Battle Arena - Where players can choose their best cards and enter against users from around the world.
2. Nifty Battle Marketplace - Where players can pick up the latest characters and collections

How it works

The first iteration of the platform will allow players to play a ‘Top Trumps’ style game where items are compared based on a variety of different scenarios -

Example with Cars:

[Untitled](https://www.notion.so/4e5222b270644849a87cd1bcaaef3170)

This model can be applied to any number of example collections - Weapons, Animals, Historical Figures, Countries etc etc

Battle Arena:

1. Player signs in with WAX account
2. Player is presented with a list of eligible NFTs
    1. If none, direct to a sales page / secondary market
3. Player chooses game type: 1, 3, or 5 card game (Different prizes on offer for each) - Player must have the number of cards available to complete game type.
4. Player confirms and enters ‘Battle Arena’
5. Player is presented with the first NFT (in random order)
6. Player selects attribute of choice (eg top Speed as above)
7. Player is presented with the next item and continues until all cards have been selected
8. Player submits
9. Player 2 completes the above and scores are compared

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?**

As mentioned above, talks have stalled with WAX but we have still continued to explore opportunities and partnerships in east Asia. Unfortunately, progress is slow on the Irish and UK leads but we continue to build the relationships and nurture the opportunities. We have new meaningful opportunities to include this month including CJ Photography, BattlePets and Andrew Maclear.

**1 CJ Photography**

As well as the Muhammad Ali photos mentioned above, eosDublin has also been working with Christina Jansen to bring together a series of photographers to present a digital exhibition with the photos being minted as NFTs on WAX and auctioned to different communities. We have images of athletes, rock icons and actors which will be made available to WAX users.

We have the agreement in place for the Ali images. We are now working on the wider exhibition and a plan for release in Q2 2021

**2 BattlePets on WAX**

BattlePets is a NFT DeFI and GameFI platform (how’s that for buzz words!) - We approached the team to do joint promotion and received massive support and created over 900 new WAX accounts. We are exploring opportunities and have submitted a proposal to the team which we will work on closing for the next submission.

Below is a snippet from the proposal:

# **Overview**

The project goal is to merge the communities of WAX and Battle Pets and offer unique NFTs for sale on WAX. WAX has over 600,000 accounts and a very active community. Battlepets.finance raised over $500k to launch on the BSC, has tens of thousands of supporters online and is now exploring opportunities for collaboration in the NFT ecosystem.

# **Goals**

1. Mint Battle Pet NFTs on WAX
    1. Made available for sale on primary and secondary marketplaces
    2. Also offer a version on Bakery NFT Market
2. Sell Series on WAX with prizes in PET for getting the rare cards
3. Explore the opportunity to wrap PET tokens on the WAX ecosystem and wrap WAXP tokens on the BSC network

# **Specifications**

## How it could work:

1. We mint random NFT packs and offer them for sale to the WAX and PET communities. Sales can take place is WAX or PET tokens
2. Players can collect, trade and sell tokens in the WAX ecosystem
3. Players can redeem rare NFTS for PET tokens and NFTs

**3 Andrew Maclear**

[http://www.andrewmaclear.com/](http://www.andrewmaclear.com/)

We have engaged with Andrew and submitted a proposal to release some of his images as NFTs on WAX. Andrew has images of some of the most iconic celebrities including John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Robert Plant and Mick Jagger. Next steps is to give Andrew a clear overview of the legal ramifications of selling his images as NFTs, he needs to have a session with his agent to discuss any image right issues (we expect none as Andrew owns the rights to all of his work)

Andrew’s images can be seen here -

**January Progress:** Little to report in January, the management team took time off for the holidays and we have not had an opportunity to have an in-depth conversation or finalise the shortlist of artists we want to showcase

**Feb Next Steps:**

1. Catch up
2. Finalise acts for the first sale
3. Finalise terms of contract (Revenue split, image rights etc)

**Label**

We will explore this further in January.

**December Progress (from last submission):** We have continued the conversation and strategy sessions and the A&R Manager has been spending the past month investigating avenues for collaboration.

**January Progress:** Not much movement with this opportunity, we had one discussion (13/01) with (A&R Manager) around image rights, licensing for artists and transferring of ownership if we conduct a sale with their roster.

We explored the possibility of using the vi.to platform to host a series of digital stages which can be attended by the holders of the wristband NFT. The event would be scheduled for the last weekend in July with a final decision to be made by end of March. We will be including more information on this opportunity next month if we can get more traction. Session scheduled with the event coordinator on Feb 8th.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

This month Annabella continued to support the social channels and again increased the followers and subscribers. Into 2021 we will be trying to bring more educational content, blockchain quickies, interviews (starting with the IG candidates this month). We also have another interview with KOGs founder Benny which we have yet to push live.

Adam presented WAX to the IMCC Investor Group and presented about WAX and NFTs for over 90 mins. This was a members only session which resulted in two possible opportunities for community development which we will be exploring in February

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

No major feedback this month. We have a frustrating situation in that scheduling and roadmap milestones are difficult to estimate with the current COVID restrictions in our area. It has not halted the new business development progress but has meant our existing opportunities have slowed. We will continue to work hard to get concrete dates in the diary and start hosting these events and sales on the wax blockchain.

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

No major feedback this month. We appreciate the work that goes into this from the IGs and want to work with the office to give feedback whenever we feel is needed. We do feel like the business development process is not optimal and feels more like a ‘show and tell’. All of this nurturing, relationship and reputation building takes time and cannot usually be condensed into monthly action points and updates.

Again we want to wish you all happy holidays and look forward to catching up with you all in the new year.

Wax On!

**Deal Information**: We have now continued the project as the Irish lockdown is coming to a close, the band hopes to be able to commence the recording and the NFT sale in December (possibly January as the release clashed with another WAX release on the date we were thinking.)

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

I hope it is clear that eosDublin are investing a significant amount of time and energy into building real businesses on WAX and bringing in new non-crypto audiences to the ecosystem. We are still working on a deal with the WAX core team to assist them in expanding their Asian footprint. This can be confirmed by Arielle but we will not be able to disclose any further information.

This month we wanted to give you significant insight (proof) in the form of email screenshots etc. In the future we are **not** in favour of this as a way to prove deal progress, it is not compliant to GDPR and presents a risk if this information is made publicly available. We are doing it now to prove the engagement and once contracts are in place and the deals are made public we can share contact information etc. It takes significant time to nurture and close opportunities which are of high importance/value.

I hope you can appreciate that we are currently investing a lot more than the current guild rewards on our WAX operation. We have expanded business development and are investing more on video content and development.

Many thanks for taking the time to read our submission.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

1.

**WAX School**

- As well as having the platform live and new students taking the courses each month. We are building out our content and organic reach and once we are happy we have everything in place we will begin a digital marketing campaign to increase traffic and awareness of all the coolness which is happening on WAX.

**2. WAX Studio**

- We continue to incubate and invest in a number of WAX specific projects. The first of which we will be bringing to market is dMerch , we have 3 Artists now each with a significant fan base who are interested in doing a dMerch pilot to their FANS. We think Christmas is the right timing for this launch and are aligning both product and marketing to have the best possible impact.

2.a. **dMerch -** This will be launching with 3 artists before the end of the year. 
3. **WAX.Community** We are still struggling with the fact that Metamask is still giving crypto users a warning for this domain. We have been testing a number of approaches to getting people to sign up and engage. Based on Feedback we will be re-organizing the community hub to give each major collectable on WAX it's own space where fans can chat and engage with each other to find cards etc.. which they are looking for. And will also have a section which will support users in the WAXP to WAXE conversion process.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Business Development?**

1.  **Multi Exchange Proposal -** We have a proposal with WAX which if approved should see WAXP listed on a number of high volume exchanges. We can't share any more publically on this but please confirm with WAX business development. 

2. **dMerch -** This will be launching with 3 brands / artists before the end of the year.

3. **MarketJS** - We are in advanced negotiations with MarketJS (and some other Game Studios) to provide a number of their games and into a rolling "crypto" arcade connecting into a WAX leaderboard.

## August 2020

Boom, August already. 2020 will certainly be a year to remember.

Firstly we would like to thank @qubicles again for all the work as IG and welcome @KAEFERGENERAL as the new IG.

We are delighted to share some more detail on what we are working on and the progress we have made this month.

As mentioned in July, we set out a plan back in the Spring to lay a foundation through our product and business development on WAX and give us a platform to build on each month. We have posted our August Community Update here: [https://wax.community/post/guild-update---eosdublin---august-2020-5f397d1f03a010693651a041](https://wax.community/post/guild-update---eosdublin---august-2020-5f397d1f03a010693651a041)

**Community Update**

Our community strategy is being executed and is getting better every day, we are compounding and compiling everything of interest and linking to them on wax.community so new and existing community members can find , share and contribute to the coolness.
As mentioned in July, We are spending less and less time in the Telegram, we see crypto scams there daily and believe it is not the best environment to bring new community members to.
Our youtube channel and twitter accounts and views continue to grow organically which will give us a great platform from which to showcase our products and projects as they are launched. To build up to it we have launched a weekly NFT giveaway the first of which happened last Friday 14th August.

## July 2020

Hello IGs

Here we are in July... What a year 2020 has been so far both globally and for the WAX project. We are delighted to share some more detail on what we are working on and the progress we have made this month.

We set out a plan back in the Spring to lay a foundation through our product development and compound on everything we do to add as much value as possible in our own unique way. We take pride in building new things and seeing ideas come to life. 

This month we had a major event where we promoted WAX and did some GPK card giveaways on a TokenClub live stream. Tokenclub have over 500,000 active crypto enthusiasts in their community. On this live steam we introduced the idea of NFTs and collectibles, the host was excited by the response his fans gave and is still getting requests from the audience on how they can get their hand on some cards. We are now working on the next phase to build on this partnership. 

We have posted our July Community Update here: [https://wax.community/post/guild-update---eosdublin---july-2020-5f14050436117c4c124aa516](https://wax.community/post/guild-update---eosdublin---july-2020-5f14050436117c4c124aa516)

We have been active in a number of WAX / GPK facebook groups which are interesting and are starting to introduce them to WAX and wax.community. 
All our products and projects are open for anyone to come join us. We are building for them, not us.

## June 2020

Hello IGs

These feel more like weekly updates than monthly, but when you look at the pace of innovation throughout the WAX community it is nothing short of breath taking.

We have been pounding away this month, compounding on our work so far and continuing to work on the things we believe are important and where we offer our unique knowledge and services. We have posted our June Community Update here : [https://wax.community/post/eosdublin---june-2020-5eebb70b82be2058c8471611](https://wax.community/post/eosdublin---june-2020-5eebb70b82be2058c8471611) 

(We know about the scam alerts if you have MetaMask or use Brave), always proceed with caution & never give away your passwords (Private Keys) **Highlights this month include:**

**Technical Update**

1. New Hyperion History Node

2. Price Feed / Oracle (ok we did this for points this month, but we are working on feeding new useful data, everyone serving the same thing is kinda wasteful)

## May 2020

Hello IGs

These months come around fast, don't they.

Thank you for the debate and discussion on our suggestions for future improvements.

It's been a crazy busy month for eosDublin, we now have 3 people working dedicated to building our WAX product portfolio, and are more excited than ever about this network and space as a whole.

I have documented our updates in this Google Document, and as always am available if you have any issues/questions or concerns.

# Updates Provided By Guild

### April 2020

We would like to give you an update before we formally announce what we have been working behind the scenes on.

Now more than ever we believe Guilds, the network and community need to work together on a number of initiatives to educate and attract users and developers and on both tooling and support for existing game studios to blockchain enable their new ideas.

**Products & Community**

As you may know we have been running [www.eosbootcamp.com](http://www.eosbootcamp.com/) for almost 2 years. And even though we haven't put any new material on there in a while, we continue to get people found around the world taking the courses in multiple languages. The vast majority is still [Blockchain Basics](http://www.eosbootcamp.com/course/blockchain-basics/) What we now know is that it is important for communities to be built around a purpose or theme. We believe strongly in industry specific projects and in the Gaming industry WAX is our network. Building on our experience so far and looking forward to the next 2-3 years we saw a need for a WAX educational platform which is built around 3 pillars / tracks. 1. Community 2. Game Studios

3. Guilds So today we are excited to share with you www.wax.school The first courses available this month will be in the community track and will be 1. Blockchain Basics 2. WAX Basics We are building wax.school to be the educational hub for WAX and blockchain gaming. We believe that the teaching materials will be mainly short form video. We will be offering wax.school to the wider community as a way to both teach and learn, and have begun work on a new "Pay with WAX" module for access to course material , We have forked a crypto payment repo which we believe is a great starting point. You can find it in our [wax-tools repo](https://github.com/wax-tools/Bitcoin-Gateway-Paid-Memberships-Pro).

**Business Development**

As we have shared in previous updates we are busy working on some deals which we believe will benefit the entire project if we are successful. What we have learned so far is that when talking with Game Studios having a Gaming specific "store front" is important. People want to work with people who "get them". We have also learned that teams are busy and in order for us to attempt to cross the chasm, we are going to have to go meet them where they are and make it easy for them to try and test new ideas and offer both resources and tools. We have decided the best way to do this is to have a new "store front" and business unit specifically for this purpose.

This week we are launching WAX.studio / www.wax.studio We are building WAX.studio to be an ecosystem where developers and guilds can advertise their services, showcase their work and collaborate on tooling and opportunities. Our first game is in development which we will showcase on wax.studio and have an accompanying course in the game studio track of wax.school so other games can be quickly developed and deployed using the same tools & techniques. We hope the IGs and WAX community understand our approach to focus efforts and resources into digital asset platforms which will be the building blocks for growth for everyone. We believe this effort will yield better results than posting tweets and medium articles or hosting online conferences where we can't yet attract people who are interested in joining this young community.

## March 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement criteria? - YES**

We organised and sponsored a Gaming / Digital Assets meetup in Dublin. The event was booked out (40 people) and we had 22 attended which were a mix of investors / games developers and blockchain excellent considering it was a Monday night and the CoVid19 virus has just arrived in Ireland.

Excellent leads generated for our Guild, we will be doing a project on Wax with one small game studio and will be organising a Wax specific event with them for Irish Blockchain Week in May.

We have also arranged for WAX to be featured on a [www.tokenclub.com](http://www.tokenclub.com/) live stream in March which normally has 80,000 + Chinese Crypto Investors tuning in. Benny from our team hosts it each week and has been tasked with looking at ways to promote WAX and our Guild in China and we have set up the WAX china telegram group to try attract people there [https://t.me/waxchina](https://t.me/waxchina) 

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Business Development criteria?** **YES**
This month we will be opening pre-enrolment for Games Studios for a course on Blockchain Game Development at [https://wax.eosio.school](https://wax.eosio.school/) We are still working on getting into a deal with Atari , Brian Elders in the picture above has a number of Digital Asset Projects which he is consulting or advising for. This is a slow burner, was getting worked out of the SORS Digital Hong Kong Office which with the Virus is impacting things, we believe they are leaning towards ETH, but we should get a chance to pitch them. Hoping we can leverage the Topps deal on this one!

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development criteria? YES** 
We have started spec'ing out a new product suite for WAX with a gaming advisor (also in the pic above). Should be able to build on this and share our progress over the coming 3 months. But it's going to be cool!

We are looking for WAX to sponsor this meetup as there will be a lot of Games Studios present.

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

It is unclear from the form what ratings are being applied. It would also be helpful if we could submit seperatly for Technical Infrastructure / Business Development as we have different people looking after each area.
