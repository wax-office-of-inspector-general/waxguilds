**Blockchain & NFT 101 Workshop**
EOS DETROIT is waiting on a response from the sponsoring organization for the blockchain and NFT 101 workshop. The structure of the deal has changed so that a charitable organization that supports arts, journalism, and culture in various American cities will cover the cost of 25 students to attend this introductory workshop that EOS DETROIT develops in partnership with [Grand Circus](https://grandcircus.co), a coding bootcamp provider. Regardless of sponsorship, the bootcamp will take place sometime in September and an Eventbrite event page will be created soon.
