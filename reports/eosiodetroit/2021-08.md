There are currently no major technical updates. Most of the TechOps team resources were spent on the migration process to our additional data center, and de-risking our primary data center which has been experiencing issues as a result of inclement weather in Michigan.

EOS DETROIT continues to service FACINGS NFT releases. In addition to FACINGS work, EOS DETROIT has hired a smart contract developer that will begin September 1st. His first project will be adding improvements to the WAX Labs interface so that proposals are pegged to a USD price, and to allow for revisions and resubmission of rejected proposals. Below are updates pertaining to FACINGS NFT releases.

** Release - Crypto Finney Vol. 1 **
The highly anticipated Crypto Finney project was released on August 20th as a WAX only release. The FACINGS provided its creative team for the artwork and it served as the technical partner for the project. At the time of writing Crypto Finney Vol. 1 release generated $81,500 in revenue - a total of over 3200 packs sold.

** Upcoming — NFTrippy **
NFTrippy is an exclusive series coming to WAX that celebrates the wonder of the mushroom! There are thousands of varieties of fungi on the planet and each has a unique profile and behaviour. NFTrippy Volume 1 showcases the diversity and characteristics of the Psilocybin variants with some mystical characters that must be crafted by foragers! It’s pseudo-science at its finest!

The marketing team has worked diligently to secure a slate of media opportunities that will be used to promote the NFTrippy collection release. Those opportunities are outlined in the Community Engagement section.

The release was originally slated for August 25th, but due to unforeseen circumstances related to issues with the Random Number Generator (RNG) on WAX testnet, the release will be pushed back a few additional weeks to allow for the new features to be adequately tested. This release will include a new crafting engine.
