## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

For this and future reports, we transferred our normal product development entries for FACINGS to ecosystem development, as they more accurately fit that description.

** WAX Labs improvements and refactoring **

EOS DETROIT is in the process of developing two feature updates for the WAX Labs platform. The first, is to use an oracle to peg the proposal price to a USD cost in WAX. The second is to allow proposers to edit and resubmit proposals that have been rejected by the admin account before the proposal goes to community vote without paying an additional fee.

This project will also include additional refactoring updates unrelated to the improvements. This project will be complete and deployed by the end of September / early October and is almost complete.

** Ep 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Internal FACINGS podcast - 8/18/2021 **

FACINGS has been maintaining its weekly podcast with appearances from FACINGS Product Manager Drew Carle, CEO Rob Konsdorf, Chief Creative Officer Lars Kommienezuspadt, and the NFTrippy team. While the views on the podcast are currently low, the footage created is used for bite sized content across our social media which has a much greater impact.

EOS DETROIT has been lending its graphic design resources to FACINGS to increase the production value of its social media and its podcast quality. In addition, it has purchased DSLR cameras, professional microphones, and sound proofing to create a studio within its downtown Detroit office to support both companies' marketing efforts. By next OIG update, the podcast will represent the visual quality you would expect of a mid to high tier podcast.
