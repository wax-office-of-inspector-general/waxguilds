EOS DETROIT has completed the deployment of our WAX infrastructure into our second datacenter for additional reliability.

In addition to that, we’ve upgraded our secondary signing node with additional RAM for a performance boost and better reliability. In addition to this, we’ve deployed this node to our second data center. We built another server with improved specs to serve as a wax full history / Atomic API.

**Upcoming - Dark Pinup: Act 2 | Release Date November 30th, 2021**
Dark Pinup is an alluring digital collectible card series with a unique dialectic style that is unlike any other collection on WAX. Act One was released in May and consists of 44 portrait style NFTs across eight unique and stunning variants. The set is focused on scarcity and presenting the photographing in compelling and interesting ways.

For Act Two, the Dark Pinup experience is preserved and expanded to offer new features, ways of collecting, and utility for our users. Everyone’s favorite rarities return with Base, Noir, Print, Memento, Artist Signature, Golden Hour (previously Model Mark), Prismatallic, and of course Candlelight returning to the spotlight. There will again be 44 base cards, and all the same rarity structure is intact, except the pack supplies have been lowered to further increase the rarity of every NFT.

The Act Two release brings a multitude of features, including crafting recipes, card upgrades, bonus airdrop roadmap, and a dungeon crawling experience in partnership with waxarena.io

To top it all off, the Act Two will also include redeemables for physical Dark Pinup cards featuring artwork from Act One.

**Blockchain & NFT 101 Workshop**
The first Blockchain & NFT 101 [workshop](https://info.grandcircus.co/nft-blockchain) in conjunction with The Knight Foundation, Venture Catalyst, and licensed coding bootcamp provider Grand Circus was a success! With over 50 applicants for the scholarship, and a total of 27 finalists selected, we were able to educate them on the blockchain basics, the benefits of the WAX blockchain for creating NFTs, how to create a WAX cloud wallet accounts, and how to create NFTs through AtomicHub. The workshop took place November 13th and 14th for 6 hours each day (4 hours of total instruction).

After attending the workshop, multiple participants were able to create their own NFTs within days and sold them via AtomicHub to their audience.

The goal for this project is to host the workshop quarterly to growing audiences at a lower price per student. Two different organizations in Michigan, including the [Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit](https://mocadetroit.org/) (MOCAD) have reached out to partner on hosting the next workshop and the team is working on expanding the partnership with the Knight Foundation. The goal is to have the next event scheduled and announced by the end of the year.
