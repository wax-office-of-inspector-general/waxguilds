## Ecosystem Development
**Continued Game Development - Pinmaster**

Following the release of Pinmaster Beta on May 31st, 2022, the DLT team has been hard at work making a variety of improvements and bug fixes to the game. Weekylreleases to the game to address bugs and implement new features. The team is currently working on finishing equipable items (shoes, bowling balls, stamina packs, etc.) as well as 10 vs 10 bowler tournament play which will feature prize money in WAX. We expect that both of these features will provide a big boost to the popularity of Pinmaster.

Sales
The WAX pack sale increased to 62% of the total sold. Unfortunately due to some bugs that did not allow the usage of new characters or characters purchased off secondary, we had a slowing of sales until the bugs could be resolved. We still expect the initial sale to be a sell out as these issues have been addressed and the full game has not been released.

The Pinmaster secondary market has done approximately 50,000 WAX worth of secondary sales on AtomicHub since the last reporting period.

Community

The Pinmaster game has observed steady social growth due to the release of the first version of the game:
The Pinmaster discord now has 4.29k members, up from 3.65K members. This represents a 17.5% organic increase in users.
The Pinmaster Twitter account followers have increased to 3.22k from 2.1k followers last reporting period, representing a 53.3% organic increase in followers.

**Game Development - NFTdraft reboot**

DLT has begun development of the new NFTdraft game. NFTdraft is a daily fantasy football style game, similar to offerings such as Draftkings. The previous development team that created the game for 2021 provided a product that ultimately ended up not being stable in the long-run and was littered with a variety of unsolvable issues due to poor design choices and a lack of understanding of how to build blockchain applications. The Season 2 pack sale will take place the last week of July. The DLT and FACINGS have already completed the set design and are prepping the pack sales website in anticipation of this launch.

Community
The NFTdraft discord has 5.55k members currently and growing.

The NFTdraft Twitter has 9.8k followers currently and growing.

**OIG Election Portal**
The OIG election portal was used for the fifth election of the OIG, which concluded on July 14th. DLT has been paying to maintain a gitlab seat that is currently used by OIGs to make modifications.

Adam Zientarski offered to make improvements/modifications to the platform in anticipation of the election on June 2nd, 2022 and received no response from the OIGs.

## Community Engagement

**Detroit Blockchain Pitchfest 2022**
Detroit Ledger Technologies is hosting the 2nd Detroit Blockchain Pitchfest on October 27th, 2022 at the Wayne County Community College Downtown Campus. The first installment was hosted in 2019. The first drew 230 attendees and awarded numerous prizes including an all expense paid trip to Silicon Valley to attend Envestnet Yodleeâ€™s accelerator program. The informational packet will be finalized early next week and a new landing page will be launched shortly afterwards to begin collecting applications for pitching.

This year, the Pitchfest has already secured judging commitments from representatives at Techstars Detroit (Global Accelerator), Backstage Capital (VC), Red Cedar Ventures (VC), General Motors (GM) Ventures (VC), Pointe Angels (Angel Investment Group), Google, and more. A judging slot has been reserved for a WAX representative. Jassy Jackson has been invited to participate.

This Pitchfest will feature startups from the ecosystems that Detroit Ledger Technologies supports, as well as other blockchain/web3 startups in the Midwest competing for a variety of prizes.

If the OIGs require additional proof that this event is being worked on and that we have these commitments, DLT is happy to provide proof of email correspondence and confirmations.
