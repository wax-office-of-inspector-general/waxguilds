EOS DETROIT is in the process of deploying servers to a third data center for additional redundancy. New improved public Atomic Assets API is now available for use. EOS DETROIT is preparing to announce an API subscription service.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

EOS DETROIT is putting the finishing touches on an open-source script that allows EOSIO developers to migrate a smart contract in an easier and faster way.

EOSIO Smart Contracts, unlike Ethereum ones, can be modified and upgraded after deployment. However, if a table is modified, a migration is required so that all data stored (old and new) follows the same structure.

Currently, there is no easy way to perform those migrations and the process can become quite tedious.

This script should be released in the next couple of weeks.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

**Game Development - Pin Master**
EOS DETROIT began development on Pin Master after the scoping engagement, starting with the character creator. The character creator will be launched in mid-March, while the first phase of the game will launch mid-to-late April. The character creator is open to whoever sponsors a character during the presale of the packs. The characters created will be the initial designs of some of the characters that can be used in the simulation games. Character creators are entitled to benefits like receiving a portion of the game currency from that character winning bowling matches.

EOS DETROIT is hosting a launch party with the Pin Master team (the company is Michigan-based) in April at a local bowling alley to raise awareness about the game and the WAX network. More details will be released in the next updates.

Blockchain & NFT Educational Program & Credential Management Platform
The full list of interested partner and funding organizations are:

1. [Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit](https://mocadetroit.org/) (MOCAD)
2. [TechTown Detroit Smart Hub](https://techtowndetroit.org/about/)
3. [West Michigan Works](https://www.westmiworks.org/)
4. [Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/ )
5. [New Economic Initiative (NEI)]( https://neweconomyinitiative.org/)
6. [Grand Circus Detroit](http://grandcircus.co )

Based on the feedback from our potential partners, EOS DETROIT is changing the structure from quarterly workshops to a year-long educational programing for different demographics (creative vs. small business owner vs. developer, etc). TechTown has verbally committed to offering 10 of its own scholarships for a small business focused program, space for the class to take place on their campus, and to be the fiduciary for a potential grant from the New Economic Initiative, a non-profit committed to the economic development of Southeast Michigan and Detroit.

EOS DETROIT continues discussions with the Knight Foundation to offer an extended program focused on creatives. The team will be distributing the initial NFT certificates of completion on WAX to the attendees of the November 2021 workshop this week. These certificates will serve as a proof of concept for an additional SaaS platform we are developing for credential management to be released in 2022. A "Powered by WAX" is included as a part of the design for these certificates.

Grand Circus has agreed to assist EOS DETROIT in getting the educational content certified through their license as a vocational education provider with the State of Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA). The process takes approximately 3 months. EOS DETROIT will issue certificates for all of the educational program cohorts it teaches and will seek to onboard additional institutions such as Bootcamp providers, colleges and universities, and vocational training providers.
