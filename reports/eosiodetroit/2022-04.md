EOS DETROIT

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

In an effort to continue to provide top-tier support for the WAX blockchain and community, we have cut ties with one of our local data center service providers due to a drop in quality of service and a lack of timely incident responses. We’ve migrated all WAX infrastructure from that location to a new rack at one of our existing data centers. In addition to that bare-metal data center migration, we now have a full history API that has been made publicly available and is in the process of standing up a WAX Hyperion API.

**Game Development - Pin Master**
EOS DETROIT is in the developmental cycle of the Pin Master project. As mentioned in last month’s report, the character creator suite was being developed by EOS DETROIT and is now live! The Character Creation Suite allows users to design custom Bowler NFTs. Choose a design from millions of character options or users can bring their own art to create a template for a Sponsored Bowler. That card is minted and mixed into  Pin Master’s Bowler Packs.
