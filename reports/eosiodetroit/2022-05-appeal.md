Hi OIGs

#### As seen below, we were given 0 points for the following criteria:


* Providing history solutions (e.g. V1, V2, dfuse, etc): 0 points
    * As seen in our wax.json, we offer a public mainnet v1-history API at: https://api.wax.eosdetroit.io/
        * If this judgment was rendered based on the blips seen in availability know that we have experienced issues requiring us to restart our v1-history endpoint every few days. We believe this to be related to the an issue referenced in the latest patch recently ported to WAX a couple weeks ago in v2.0.14. This should not be an issue moving forward.
            * v2.0.14 Patch note referenced: `“Fixed handling for deltas bigger than uint32_t size can indicate. This was an issue for Wax.”`
* Providing test-net history solution: 0 points
    * As seen in our wax.json, we offer a public testnet Hyperion V2 API at: https://hyperion.testnet.wax.detroitledger.tech/
    * As seen in our wax.json, we offer a public testnet v1-history API at: https://testnet.wax.detroitledger.tech/
 

#### Regarding “OIG Notes - No HTTP2 on RPC”
Is this in reference to https://api.wax.eosdetroit.io/?
We have confirmed we do, in fact, support HTTP2. If I am misunderstanding this, please provide the endpoint that is being referred to.


#### Regarding criteria Providing useful APIs (e.g. SimpleAssets, AtomicAssets) (0 to 2):
What determines the difference between 1 and 2 points? We host public AtomicAssets APIs on both mainnet and testnet. Being that we were awarding 1 point in this category - does this mean OIG does not offer points for running instances and/or instances on both mainnet and testnet?


#### Product Development

* Pinmaster

  * The first version of the Pinmaster game was deployed shortly before the reporting period, not in development. While we are working on adding additional gameplay styles (10 vs. 10 bowler tournaments) and working on bug fixes, the game is playable. We met with David Kim a few weeks ago inquiring about an advertising partnership and he indicated that the feature set present at launch meets their playability criteria for an advertising partnership.

  * Additionally, while the ETH sale was small in total number of accounts, it was successful at attracting some whales from ETH to participate in the WAX ecosystem.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication to WAX.
