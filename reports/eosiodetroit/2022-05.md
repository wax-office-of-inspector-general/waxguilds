## Product Development
**Smart Contract Migration Tool Open-Sourced**
Our team has created a very useful script that creates supporting tables for the tables that are to be migrated on the WAX blockchain or other eosio blockchains. This migration script adds a temporary migration table that controls the migration status. Once completed, it creates and executes the first migration action which copies all the data from the selected tables to the supported tables. Those rows are then deleted from the original table. Lastly, the script creates and executes the second migration action, which moves back all the data from the support tables to the original tables. During this process we make sure all Smart Contract actions are frozen until the migration has been completed, to avoid unexpected outcomes.

This project is not specific to WAX, but received a sizable matching grant from the ENF as recognition of our hard work & code quality.

## Ecosystem Development
**Game Development - Pinmaster**

The first version of the Pinmaster game was released May 31st. The initial release allows users to participate in “bot” simulated bowling matches so that they may begin gaining experience on their bowlers. In the coming weeks, the DLT team will release head-to-head 10 bowler team tournament play with weekly prize pools in conjunction with the Onboard Games team. DLT will provide play usage metrics next update.

Through the second half of April and May, DLT performed two separate sales. The first sale was a sale that allowed ETH to be accepted as payment and onboarded those users to create a WAX Cloud Wallet which is used to interact with the bowling character creator. 168 characters from 69 unique ETH addresses were created as a result of the sale for a total value of over $20,000 in revenue. The code was created in a way that it will be reused for additional releases and may be open sourced.

The second sale was the WAX pack sale that dropped May 25th, 2022. These packs included the bowling characters that were created over the past 2 months with the character creator as well as a number of consumable and equipment items to be used in combination with bowlers. At the time of writing, the pack drop has received steady sales and has sold out 52.29% of its total inventory. We expect this to sell out in the next 1 - 2 weeks.

The Pinmaster game is also garnering attention through various channels:
The Pinmaster discord has accumulated 3.65K members, with 500-600 online on average. The Pinmaster Twitter account is also up to 2.1k followers.
Twitch streamer BD_AO (1.2K followers) interviewed the Pinmaster team resulting in over 700 views, his highest performing video.
NFT Influencer @shelleymaeph (6.1K followers) promoted the Pinmaster pack giveaway.

**FACINGS**

The FACINGS product team, outside of assisting on the Pinmaster release for set design and providing some of the core technology to execute on pack releases has been heads down working diligently to continue development of the MVP of its platform in addition to chipping away at its SAFE round fundraising effort.

Total social audience increased 1.05% to 4906 followers over the course of this reporting period.

**Game Development - Future Release - NFTDraft reboot**

DLT will begin the development on a previously scoped project - the reboot of fantasy American football game NFTdraft.io. This game is expected to be released prior to the beginning of the season on September 8th, 2022 and will leverage some of the technology developed for Pinmaster and FACINGS.

## Community Engagement
DLT hosted a local event titled [The Digital Download: P2E Games Q&A](https://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Blockchainers/events/285995878/) to present/discuss P2E Gaming and the release of Pinmaster. Approximately 20 people attended the event, including a promising lead for another game to launch on WAX.

DLT & FACINGS team members have also served in a community management capacity for the Pinmaster discord.

The OIG should consider submitting a disaster recovery plan & business continuity plan as a part of their criteria. These documents are expected by large scale clients/corporations and are in general considered a best practice of any business.
