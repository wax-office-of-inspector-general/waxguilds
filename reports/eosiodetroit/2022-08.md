## Tech Ops

* WAX LightAPI instance now available at: [https://lightapi.wax.detroitledger.tech](https://lightapi.wax.detroitledger.tech)

### Incident Response

We have been actively following the incident that began over the weekend. Although we are not currently in an active position, we are doing what we can by performing an audit of our WAX Infrastructure and applying the recommended configuration changes that have been brought up to optimize performance. Our nodes all currently have subjective billing enabled and our WAX state-history nodes feeding our AtomicAssets & Hyperion APIs have read-mode set to head per discussion in the WAX Guilds channels. We are looking at standing up additional infrastructure to implement the sentry node architecture design.

## Product Development

**Nodesuite - Additional Playbook Released**

* Released Hyperion API Playbook

* Automated remote installation and configuration of Hyperion API and its dependencies (Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, node, …)

**eospyo**

DLT and FACINGS have been maintaining eospyo, a Python library for interacting with Antelope smart contracts, for close to a year. DLT failed to list this project in its product development section for WAX since the beginning of the project.

The following work was performed during the months of May and June, primarily by DLT at the direction of a senior FACINGS engineer who started the project:

-   Backend/native serialization implementation
    
-   Custom types (such as asset for transfer transactions) and serialization methods required to support most types of chain transactions
  

Work performed this reporting period:

-   DLT with the help of FACINGS released an in-depth tutorial this period of how to use eospyo and best practices, as well as a comparison of similar libraries.
    
-   https://detroitledgertech.medium.com/eospyo-tutorial-ff63a0f759ee

DLT will be the primary maintainer of this library moving forward, and will be working to add CI/CD pipelines and some known bug fixes next reporting period.

## Ecosystem Development

### Continued Game Development - Pinmaster

DLT completed two major features this reporting period in addition to various bug fixes on Pinmaster. 10v10 PVP tournaments are still in development because the a large portion of the tournament system will also be used for NFTdraft, and the team needed to fully focused on that project to meet an immovable deadline for NFTdraft (details below). Tournament functionality will be revisited and finished after the initial launch of NFTdraft.

**Equipable Items**

Pinmaster users are now able to equip their in-game equipment items, provide stat boosts to bowlers. The items that can be equipped are bowling balls (increase power, point floor, or point ceiling), gloves (increase max control), shoes, and stamina boxes (increase max stamina). This feature uses an on-chain custodian contract that holds the equipment items.

**Pin Store MVP**

To alleviate a shortage of Pins, the in-game currency gained by burning Pin NFTs of various denominations, DLT created drops on Neftyblocks and programmed the new templates to be consumable in-game. This allowed Pinmaster users to increase the rank of their bowlers, allowing them to increase their bowler level past 20 and eventually prestige their bowler. The Pin Store will eventually be transitioned to the FACINGS minting backend and consolidated into the Pinmaster UI.

**Usage Statistics**

Below are usage statistics. Due to team members being on vacation, we did not get our statistics in the last reporting period.

* Number of total users: 628

* New users (since July 16th): 57

* Number of active users (since July 16th): 227

* Number of games bowled (total): 2,369,236

* Number of games bowled (since July 16th): 1,444,038

Bowling statistics are achievable because of the game’s quick bowl feature.

 **Sales**

The Pinmaster secondary market and Pin Shop have done approximately 35,000 WAX worth of sales during this reporting period.

### FACINGS

**NFT Collection Manager**

FACINGS is building an open source NFT Collection Manager, which received a grant approval from the ENF. It is a reference frontend for the AtomicAsset standard anyone can use, and is fully compatible with the WAX network. DLT engineers are also assisting with the front-end development of the Collection Manager. Beyond that FACINGS has powered multiple NFT sales for Pinmaster and NFTdraft, and launched the Viva pack leaderboard event for the darkpinup collection, driving volume and engagement on WAX.

**Dark Pinup Viva Packs**
Dark Pinup Viva packs launched on July 21st. After a little over one month of running the promotion, 58 users have participated in the event which encourages the purchase of Act 2 Dark Pinup Packs or crafting & burning of existing cards.

The leaderboard for the event can be found here: https://darkpinup.com/#/leaderboard
  
### Continued Game Development - NFTdraft

DLT deployed NFTdraft to the testnet during this reporting period. The game is set to launch a few days prior to the beginning of the NFL season, which begins September 8th at 8:30 PM ET.

**Sales**

During this reporting period, DLT performed two discounted pack sales for NFTdraft. The first sale took place August 5th and was for “VIPs” composed of weekly winners from the last season who hold ring or trophy NFTs and a small whitelist for 24 hours. After the first 24 hours, the sale was open to the public for an additional 24 hours. This sale resulted in 111,420.24 WAX and $10,8000 USD in revenue. This sale also received cross promotional support from WAX via a tweet: https://twitter.com/NFTDRAFT/status/1555976955123699713.

 
The second sale, which started on August 29th and is currently running, stepped the price of the packs up but are still discounted from full price. This sale will run until kickoff, at which point the packs will remain at full price for the remainder of the season. As of submission this sale has resulted in 26785.81 WAX and $2888.45 USD in revenue.

This drop represented a unique challenge in that NFTdraft offers large packs (150 cards), with odds that could provide the user with potentially of over 2200 different templates.

NFTdraft has generated approximately 95,000 WAX in secondary sales since July 16th. The announcement of the return of NFTdraft revived the secondary market for Season 1 cards which are usable in Season 2 as well. NFTdraft has a feature that lets the user blend the same templates together to increase the rank of the card, providing score bonuses and cost-to-play bonuses for that NFL player’s performance that week.

**Social/Community**

The NFTdraft discord grew to 6.3k members, up 13.5% from the last reporting period.

The NFTdraft Twitter has remained steady at approximately 9.8k followers due to pruning.

## Community Engagement

### Detroit Blockchain Pitchfest 2022

Due to a travel freeze for WAX team members, WAX representatives will be unable to participate as a judge for the event, but are evaluating sponsorship opportunities for the event. The applications for the Pitchfest are now open and DLT will be personally inviting companies building on WAX to apply to pitch. Metrics on the number of WAX companies that applied and are accepted to pitch will be provided next reporting period. The website has also been launched for the event which you can find below.

### Governance/Process Recommendations

Potentially define a standard nodeos logging configuration  
Potentially have BPs collaborate through dumping logs fitting that standard into a repository accessible by all guilds.

Reasoning: Oftentimes with nodeos, it's hard to even tell what a healthy system looks like with all the noise in the built-in logging. At least if we're collecting this data everyone can see what "healthy" looks like. This could be something added to tech ops criteria.
  
Define incident severity classifications and establish a process for mandatory post-mortems, reward / penalize guilds depending on the participation or lack thereof.
