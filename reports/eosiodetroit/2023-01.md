**FACINGS**

FACINGS Creator (NFT Collection Manager)

The FACINGS Creator is a tool for managing AtomicAssets NFT collections, based upon the open source collection-manager project funded by ENF Grants. The goal is to provide a streamlined and intuitive experience for creators to manage their NFT collections. The initial version provides core features needed to interact with AtomicAssets functionality on WAX and EOS. In the next major version, we aim to provide a plugin system and deeper functionality added via plugins, as well as additional UX enhancements. DLT engineers contributed to the UI/UX design work and code of the FACINGS Creator.

FACINGS has submitted another grant request to continue development work on the open-source project. You can find the details of the second grant here: https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/pull/113/commits/8b2718ad5a8cf499bc1b0ec91b05b094f5934924

The WAX How-To article has been updated to include FACINGS as an option to mint NFTs. https://wax-io.medium.com/a-beginners-guide-to-the-wax-blockchain-and-nfts-ead6ccac422a
