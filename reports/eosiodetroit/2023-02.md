**WAX Labs**

  

After meeting with the OIG in February, the DLT team began working on some UI/UX improvement mockups for WAX Labs (version 2.1?). Those mockups can be found here: [https://www.figma.com/file/ixLMuZIwKH2Vba9nHbhp45/Wax-Labs?node-id=39%3A39](https://www.figma.com/file/ixLMuZIwKH2Vba9nHbhp45/Wax-Labs?node-id=39%3A39)

  
The team also began a proposal document to present to the OIGs which will outline the suggested changes and sprint roadmap for making those changes. The OIG can expect a similar document, such as the proposal we successfully completed for Telos RFP next week: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nJRCJVnT-uDq-pvOZUCqKvUlKoC9aolQR9g5j9CWkyc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nJRCJVnT-uDq-pvOZUCqKvUlKoC9aolQR9g5j9CWkyc/edit?usp=sharing)

  

DLT believes that this should be considered for points as WAX Labs was originally a DLT project that was previously decayed, and spending resources to create the mockups and plan, which will be made public upon completion, signifies reignited support for the project.

  

**FACINGS**

  

FACINGS Creator (NFT Collection Manager)

  

The second ENF grant, totalling $180,000, was recently approved and work has already begun on making the improvements from the proposal. Of the listed improvements the following are relevant to the WAX ecosystem:  
  

-   Implementation of the remaining AtomicAssets SC actions
    
-   Data handling/validation
    
-   Typescript implementation
    
-   Plugin Architecture (allows others to create plugins that work with the creator)
    
-   Data standard & import functionality
    
-   Smart airdrops
    

  

As a reminder, the goal is to provide a streamlined and intuitive experience for creators to manage their NFT collections. The initial version provides core features needed to interact with AtomicAssets functionality on WAX and EOS. DLT engineers also regularly contribute to this project directly in addition to FACINGS engineers.
