**WAX Labs**

  

DLT and the IGs continued discussion on improvements to the WAX Labs platform. Based on the call that took place April 11th, 2023, the next steps were to provide a sprint-based estimate to perform the upgrades.

  

The estimations for Wax Labs V3 will be sent to [ig@wax.io](mailto:ig@wax.io). The cost estimation range represents an extreme best-case and worst-case scenario. For example, the high-end, worst-case scenario represents the cost of a complete rebuild from the ground up and the low-end represents most of the underlying code being able to be reused and no additional services needing to be created, etc.  
  

**FACINGS**

  

FACINGS Creator (NFT Collection Manager)

  

FACINGS has made great progress on the grant awarded by the ENF for the second phase of the open-source NFT Collection Manager interface. The first milestone was completed and recently received the first two approvals needed to consider the work complete. FACINGS has also nearly completed the work guaranteed by the second milestone for the project (data standards and import functionality).

  

Completed;

-   Plugin Architecture (allows others to create plugins that work with the creator)
    
-   Data standard & import functionality
    

  

WIP:

-   Smart airdrops
    
-   Implementation of the remaining AtomicAssets SC actions
    
-   Data handling/validation
    
-   Typescript implementation
    

  

FACINGSâ€™ goal is to provide a streamlined and intuitive experience for creators to manage their NFT collections. The initial version provides core features needed to interact with AtomicAssets functionality on WAX and EOS. DLT engineers also regularly contribute to this project directly in addition to FACINGS engineers.
