**WAX Labs**

  

DLT and the IGs concluded their discussions regarding the WAX Labs 3.0 proposal. Additional work was done on the UI mockups based on feedback from the IGs and the finalized proposal was submitted to the current WAX Labs system, which can be found here: [https://labs.wax.io/proposals/135](https://labs.wax.io/proposals/135)

  

The DLT team is on standby pending final approval from the WAX team.  
  

**FACINGS**

  

FACINGS Creator (NFT Collection Manager)

  

Over the past month and a half, FACINGS has had to switch development priorities from finishing Milestone 2 of the Creator Suite for its active ENF grant. Due to the continued bearish market and unforeseen circumstances, FACINGS needed to perform some critical maintenance and replace a key vendor for processing of credit cards. Some of these items include:

  

-   Sourcing new credit card processing partners
    
-   Upgrade the backend to have multiple configurable credit card processors
    
-   Collection maintenance - Burn extra NFT inventory of existing client collections with their approval to decrease the supply and value for long-term collectors
    

  

In addition to this critical work, the team also spent time making a variety of other improvements, such as:

-   Improving the stability of FACINGS’ pack opener
    
-   Additional/clearer UI validation error messages
    
-   General bug fixes
    

  

Lastly, the product team spent time developing the roadmap for a “sales widget” that builds off the FACINGS’ plugin architecture.

  

FACINGS’ goal is to provide a streamlined and intuitive experience for creators to manage their NFT collections. The initial version provides core features needed to interact with AtomicAssets functionality on WAX, EOS, and Telos. DLT engineers also regularly contribute to this project directly in addition to FACINGS engineers.

  

The development of this project takes place in a private gitlab instance until it is submitted with the ENF Grant Milestone.
