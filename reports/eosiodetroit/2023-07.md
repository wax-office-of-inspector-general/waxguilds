**WAX Labs**

During the past evaluation period, DLT received the full approval from the WAX team on its WAX Labs 3.0 proposal. The first milestone of the project is already complete and was submitted for the WAX team to review and approve. The milestone submission can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12_IHwSB0jzHMJJTiJKkKbSVn7N1Ab_bmxcTS6ldBMi4/edit?usp=sharing

DLT meets with the IGs once per month to provide a demo of the current milestone and provides weekly updates to the IGs in email. The second milestone is already underway and is expected to be completed on schedule.

**FACINGS**

FACINGS Creator (NFT Collection Manager)

The second milestone has been completed and submitted to the ENF for approval. The pull request for that milestone can be found here: https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-milestones/pull/106/commits

The work for the second milestone primarily encompasses the collection/template CSV import feature, allowing users to bulk create schemas and templates and broadcast those transactions with ease.

Work on the 3rd milestone has already begun and a more substantial update will be delivered next report regarding the progress of its completion.

FACINGSâ€™ goal is to provide a streamlined and intuitive experience for creators to manage their NFT collections. The initial version provides core features needed to interact with AtomicAssets functionality on WAX and EOS. DLT engineers also regularly contribute to this project directly in addition to FACINGS engineers.

The development of this project takes place in a private gitlab instance until it is submitted with the ENF Grant Milestone.
