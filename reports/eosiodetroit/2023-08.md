**WAX Labs**

During the last evaluation period, the second milestone was completed and submitted to the WAX team for their approval. The team is also nearly complete with the third and final milestone, with the outstanding item being the telegram notifications. DLT is currently waiting for feedback from the IGs regarding the spec 

DLT meets with the IGs once per month to provide a demo of the current milestone and provides weekly updates to the IGs in email. The last meeting will be scheduled with IGs after the scoring & conclusion of this evaluation period.

The team has also determined that email notifications could also be added leveraging some of the work that went into telegram notifications. If schedule permits, the team will add email notifications to the final release or provide an update shortly after the deployment of WAX Labs 3.0.

**FACINGS**

FACINGS Creator (NFT Collection Manager)

The second milestone was recently approved by the ENF and merged in the public repository.

https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-milestones/pull/106

The work for the second milestone encompassed the collection/template CSV import feature, allowing users to bulk create schemas and templates and broadcast those transactions with ease.

The work for the third and final Creator milestone was performed and completed during this reporting period. Milestone 3 implemented the airdrop plugin, which allows creators to easily mass distribute NFTs. This can be useful to projects providing rewards to their holders when community milestones are reached.

Milestone 3 Pull request: https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-milestones/pull/122/commits/4a27ee235461cb553eabd7da5c77d5a5f4de5b70


FACINGSâ€™ goal is to provide a streamlined and intuitive experience for creators to manage their NFT collections. The initial version provides core features needed to interact with AtomicAssets functionality on WAX and EOS. DLT engineers also regularly contribute to this project directly in addition to FACINGS engineers.
