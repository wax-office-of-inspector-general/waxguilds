**WAX Labs**

During the last evaluation period, the third milestone was completed and submitted to the WAX team for their approval. This milestone included additional work outside of scope to have notifications also send emails.

DLT will provide a hash to the WAX team to deploy via IPFS. DLT will also continue to host the minimal backend infrastructure required to power the notifications system and provide documentation in the event that DLT must stop providing that infrastructure. Finally, DLT will also provide maintenance, package updates, etc. as needed going forward.

**FACINGS**

FACINGS Creator (NFT Collection Manager)

The third milestone was recently approved by the ENF and merged in the public repository.

Milestone 3 implemented the airdrop plugin, which allows creators to easily mass distribute NFTs. During this reporting period FACINGS received a number of bug reports and provided fixes to the airdrop plugin in addition to other maintenance work such as implementing Wharfkit and adding analytics.

Milestone 3 Pull request: https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-milestones/pull/122

In addition to the milestone 3 work, FACINGS added two new features: A profile page and NFT inventory page.

FACINGSâ€™ goal is to provide a streamlined and intuitive experience for creators to manage their NFT collections. The initial version provides core features needed to interact with AtomicAssets functionality on WAX and EOS. DLT engineers also regularly contribute to this project directly in addition to FACINGS engineers.

## Ecosystem Development

DLT switched accounting software providers to Cryptoworth during this reporting period. As a term of agreement, DLT required that they added a WAX integration to automatically pull and calculate cost basis for the native token. This functionality was completed during this reporting period and DLT is working on introducing the Cryptoworth marketing team to the WAX marketing team so that the companies can promote this development.
