**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

The 4 new servers purchased last month are now fully up and running. We have continued our
migration from the cloud to our own bare metal servers hosted at a local data center and our
WAX nodes will be out of the cloud (with the exception of failovers) this week. Our goal is to
have the majority of our infrastructure on self owned bare metal by the end of August. This
month, we have also begun testing out new hardware for our servers. Along with the improved
hardware, this R&D will ultimately help us improve the performance of our servers across not
only WAX but all of the chains we support, most notably the performance of our APIs in order to
keep up with the growing demands of the network.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

EOS DETROIT has launched a totally new subsidiary called FACINGS ([http://facings.io/](http://facings.io/)) that is
working to empower creators by putting everything publishers and artists need to
manage their NFT collections in one place, and streamlining the path to offering rich
NFT experiences for anyone. FACINGS has already helped a number of brands launch
end-to-end NFT campaigns via our concierge services. These brands include,
GPK.Topps Bernventures, Dark Pinup, Owens Cricket Game Cards, and Cryptowriter’s
Finney Coin NFT release.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?**

For the month of May, we’ve launched our first in-house NFT series through FACINGS called
Dark Pinup ([https://darkpinup.com/#/home](https://darkpinup.com/#/home)). This NFT release has been widely accepted, with
the 30 pack digital cards selling out within hours of the release.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

We had a chance to host a virtual event for a group of professionals from the Metro-Detroit area
that gave them a crash-course on cryptos, various blockchains and the benefits of using WAX
blockchain to launch NFTs.

## April 2021

**TECH OPS** 

We've purchased additional servers in the process of being set up at a local data center. This hardware will facilitate the migration of a number of EOSIO nodes onto more performant and reliable hardware. Among other services being migrated, our Hyperion and AtomicAssets API nodes are currently syncing on new dedicated servers. An additional blocks-only seed instance has been created for participation in the Guild wireguard network.

**PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT** 

We have been spending a great deal of our resources on developing a large application/service utilizing the WAX platform. We recently seeded an NFT platform to the tune of $50,000 USD with additional funding to come.

**ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT** 

Currently focused on an internal NFT release in anticipation for a May publication.   **COMMUNITY**

This month we hosted a presentation to a large audience at Michigan State University to evangelize the use of NFTs by discussing their many potential applications while displaying the ease of onboarding to WCW, hosting a Q&A session, and a giveaway. We are constantly seeking speaking opportunities to spread the word about WAX to garner the attention of developers, collectors, and anyone else interested in NFTs.

## March 2021

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

Our Atomic API with Hasuara GraphQL endpoints is now live. Ledger powered msigs are now set up for most BP transactions.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?**

We provided our NFT launch tech stack, development services, and technical expertise to the [OW3NS](http://owens.app/) fantasy cricket card game. This release was the most successful unverified Atomic Hub release. We also signed an agreement to do a music & collectable NFT release with an award winning Detroit rap artist, which is slated to be released sometime in May.

3 pieces of our artwork are featured in the [CryptoFinney](https://writer.io/nft/#) NFT release by [writer.io](http://writer.io/).

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

We created and promoted the Take To The Streets Giveaway (Street Fighter), in which we gave our own NFTs which included 5 #1 mint cards, 3 starter packs, and 2 ultimate packs. The winners were announced on Cryptoblood's livestream. An original piece of content was produced and promoted, dispelling the myth of NFTs being bad for the environment and promoting the other advantages of creating NFTs on WAX rather than Ethereum. We also helped facilitate and promote a community member's giveaway for the Bernventures release (this was not included in a prior OIG update). We continue to remain active in various telegram chats to assist the WAX user base with questions regarding new NFT releases.

## February 2021

**TECH OPS**

We moved our BP signing node to baremetal before the Street Fighter launch and saw a marked improvement on performance. Our next priority after baremetal signing nodes will be to provide beefier APIs we can eventually guarantee a SLA on.

**PRODUCT DEV**

WAX Labs soft launches this week, the WAX team plans to coordinate the launch with an eventual marketing push in early March. Also improving the frontend for the WAX OIG election portal to provide a better UX for the next election.

Beyond that we are providing advice and support to many looking to build on WAX. Our art has been featured in two GPK releases as we continue to work with Topps to drive high quality artwork in their NFTs.

**COMMUNITY**

I've spoken about WAX on GreyBTC and JimmyD / EOSIO weekly podcast over the prior month. In January I discussed WAX and blockchain in general on a local business podcast run by an accounting firm. Our team continues to invest time on educating people about the opportunity here, as well as support in WAX groups on telegram.

## January 2021

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

We're signed up with a local DC and actively migrating nodes. Aiming to have our WAX BP on Baremetal by the end of Q1. Baremetal tests are going well, but as WAX is one of the most used networks that we operate we did not choose to migrate it first.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

We're in the final rounds of garnering feedback from WAX on WAX Labs. Aiming for a launch end of this upcoming week, if the feedback is able to land in time. Otherwise it should happen the following week. Still supporting NFT campaigns on WAX as well.

# Pre-Evaluation Form Responses

### Please provide some information regarding when and how your Guild got involved with the EOSIO or WAX ecosystem. Links to resources are helpful.

Robrigo has been tinkering on DPOS networks since 2014, and has spent time contributing in the Bitshares, Steem, EOS, Telos, and greater EOSIO communities, under the EOS Detroit banner since early 2018.WAX piqued our team's interest when we found out about the governance changes to the network. Upon researching, it became apparent that WAX was a valuable and differentiated project with a well-capitalized and professional team that already had successful core business products. The fundamentals were good, so we decided to throw our hat in the ring and participate.

### Has anyone in the Guild previously produced blocks on an EOSIO or DPOS network in the past? If so, which ones and what nodes did they help operate?

Produced on Telos, Worbli, UOS, Steem, Soundac, Peerplays, and various testnets. Standby on EOS.

EOS Detroit has a number of Showcase initiatives under way to build value for WAX:

1. eosio-bp-playbooks, a general swiss army knife of Ansible playbooks for deploying eosio and supporting services across many networks in an automated and repeatable way. 
Current status: closed beta, with a goal to open source by end of year.

2. Polygon, an invoicing system that leverages stable-coins escrowed in smart contracts to improve remuneration for small businesses and independent contractors.
Current status: prototype by end of year.

3. Early stages of setting up an EOSIO accelerator program in partnership with a global co-
working space backed by institutional investors. Current status: raising funds.

4. Hosting an international conference in 2020 at a premier Detroit venue targeted at the greater blockchain, technology, and business communities (not just EOSIO). Current status: planning.

https://www.meetup.com/eos-detroit/

Decent social reach on Youtube and Twitter. 

No usage metrics; consumer facing products still in development.
