Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively… Increased load on the network created a need for us to systematically upgrade all hardware and internet services which has been a large piece of work but we are now successfully upgraded and future proofed for another year ... maybe ;)

We have successfully indexed WAX on the new 3.3.4-rc4 version of Hyperion and are providing Full History V1/V2 for the WAX Mainnet. This history service is very busy at the moment at around 60 requests / sec
https://wax.eosphere.io/v2/health

This last month we have continued to run the cc32d9 v2.0.12wax01 WAX software and will consider going to the newer v2.1.0 enabled fork when available.

Currently our WAX Hyperion shows that it is missing block 1, however this is how a feeding state-history node presents block data. In future Hyperion releases this will be taken into account so that it does not show as an error.

We are also keeping up our WAX Snapshot Service.. and expect to expand it out for all other chains that we support.

We have been bumped into the Mainnet #21 slot this month a few times and produced on and off as a standby, we are below the targeted 0.35ms median and our reliability is within threshold.

We are providing an API for the Atomic Assets service:

### Monitoring and Alerts Platform
We have started development of a WAX Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts Platform built specifically for Guild’s operating a large footprint of WAX nodes. This has already been presented in our OIG one-on-one

This platform is being built to privately monitor and alert operators on events in relation to:
- EOSIO Nodeos
- Atomic API
- Hyperion History

Of course this platform will be released opensource and it aims to uplift performance, operational hygiene and visibility to ensure the WAX network delivers effectively for the growing number of DApps and NFT’s.

### emanate
We have been partners with emanate (https://emanate.live) since 2018 , if you weren’t already aware emanate is a music contacts platform with 1000’s of real world artists already signed up .. including deadmau5 and Goldilox. In conversations with Sean Gardener the CEO, we have influenced the team to make use of the WAX Protocol network’s ability to support NFT’s and a digital marketplace. Emanate’s music industry partners have been consulted and are onboard to create and market NFT’s tied to artists and music (yes music enabled NFT’s).

RAREZ™ is a new brand that has been created by Blockchain Music Pty Ltd (Emanate) for the Series 1 collectibles. RAREZ aims to bring scarce digital collectables, digital music releases and other blockchain-based assets to the music industry.

We have previously brokered very positive conversations between wax.io and Emanate, which has eventuated in the release of a deadmau5 NFT event. The event was a complete success with all packs sold out and has genuinely brought many non-crypto users to the experience of NFTs.

After the success of deadmau5 and the world recognised Rock Band “Weezer” NFT campaign, the team are looking to the next NFT Artist .. I’m told it will take a little while longer. Obviously the plan is to keep pushing Artist NFT’s through the Rarez brand.

As deadmau5 looks to take his shows into a dedicated VR world next year, his 20 million followers will start looking at digital merchants over physical merchandising and we have already made an impact to these fans by familiarising them with the WAX ecosystem. I honestly think this will be huge for the WAX Protocol Network and NFTs in general.

Emanate is also seriously considering moving more of their music service structure to WAX (This is absolutely a work in progress) , taking advantage of the Cloud Wallet and positive NFT community messaging. Right now there is some focus on designing and building a WAX Marketplace specifically for RAREZ™, however it is too soon to announce.. I will share details when the strategy is more solidified.

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

We are currently building RAREZ for/with Emanate! Look out for a mobile app in the near future ;)

We had 2x 30min consultations this month, which wern’t specifically WAX .. however we are mid contract for a private chain specifically in the resources space… perhaps NFT’s will be a requirement in the future.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with Jassy from WAX.

EOSphere and rewired.one (including our dfuse partnership / which will soon be superseded by an alternate) are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing
We will be publishing our Monthly OIG update regularly in the EOSphere Blog and advertising across our applicable socials.

### Twitter
We are active on our twitter feed with over 5,000 followers and are absolutely a strong marketing and engagement channel for WAX

### WAX Technical How To
Starting this month we are publishing a series of articles called “WAX Technical How To”. 
The #1 edition starts with the basics of setting up a WAX Testnet Node.

https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-1-4cc5c9aa8d4e

We are planning to regularly release Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. I have emailed the OIG a few examples of this.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
Community building and product development is of course key to the growth of an ecosystem.

However, the WAX Mainnet has become an extremely busy and demanding blockchain. A high level of performance hardware and operational experience are required to successfully run the platform and needed services, way beyond Block Production. High speed API’s and History solutions as an example.

I’d ask the OIG to consider increasing the technology weighting in future evaluations.
