## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively

We have successfully indexed WAX on the new 3.3.4-rc4 version of Hyperion and are providing Full History V1/V2 for the WAX Mainnet. This history service is still very busy at the moment at around 20 to 200 requests / sec . It's also very disk consuming growing at 20 - 30GB / day .. we added more disk this last month.

As the previous month we have continued to run the cc32d9 v2.0.12wax01 WAX software and will consider going to the newer v2.1.0 enabled fork when available.

Currently our WAX Hyperion shows that it is missing block 1, however this is how a feeding state-history node presents block data. In future Hyperion releases this will be taken into account so that it does not show as an error.

We are also keeping up our WAX Snapshot Service.. and expect to expand it out for all other chains that we support.

We have been been in the top #21 this month and are below the targeted 0.35ms median and our reliability is within threshold.

Our chains.json points to:

We are providing an API for the Atomic Assets service:

### Monitoring and Alerts Platform
We have continued development of our WAX Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts Platform built specifically for Guild’s operating a large footprint of WAX nodes. This has already been presented in our OIG one-on-one last month

This platform is being built to privately monitor and alert operators on events in relation to:
- EOSIO Nodeos
- Atomic API
- Hyperion History

Of course this platform will be released opensource and it aims to uplift performance, operational hygiene and visibility to ensure the WAX network delivers effectively for the growing number of DApps and NFT’s.

This month work was done on the Graphical User Experience which is coming along nicely.. still need a logo though. Most importantly this month we have finalised development of our polling monitor engine that will scale efficiently when 100’s of nodes are covered.

### emanate
We have been partners with emanate (https://emanate.live) since 2018 , if you weren’t already aware emanate is a music contacts platform with 1000’s of real world artists already signed up .. including deadmau5 and Goldilox. In conversations with Sean Gardener the CEO, we have influenced the team to make use of the WAX Protocol network’s ability to support NFT’s and a digital marketplace. Emanate’s music industry partners have been consulted and are onboard to create and market NFT’s tied to artists and music (yes music enabled NFT’s).

We have previously brokered very positive conversations between wax.io and Emanate, which has eventuated in the release of a deadmau5: Series 1 NFT launched out of the Emanate RAREZ™ brand.

RAREZ™ is a new brand that has been created by Blockchain Music Pty Ltd (Emanate) for NFT collectibles. RAREZ aims to bring scarce digital collectables, digital music releases and other blockchain-based assets to the music industry.

This month deadmau5 and RAREZ™ are kicking it into gear by launching deadmau5: Series 2 NFT Collectables. The Sale starts on Friday, August 26th, 2021

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

We are currently building RAREZ for/with Emanate! Look out for a mobile app in the near future ;)

We had 4 x 30min consultations this month, which wern’t specifically WAX .. however we are mid contract for a private chain specifically in the resources space… perhaps NFT’s will be a requirement in the future.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with Jassy from WAX.

EOSphere and rewired.one (including our dfuse partnership / which will soon be superseded by an alternate) are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing
We publish our Monthly community update regularly in the EOSphere Blog and advertise across our applicable socials.

### Twitter
We are active on our twitter feed with over 5,000 followers and are absolutely a strong marketing and engagement channel for WAX

### WAX Technical How To
Last month we started publishing a series of articles called “WAX Technical How To”. 

The #1 edition started with the basics of setting up a WAX Testnet Node.
Set Up a WAX Testnet Node -> https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-1-4cc5c9aa8d4e

This month we published the #2 edition that covers the topic of Wax Snapshots.
How to use WAX Snapshots -> https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-2-db45a339e735

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. Below are a few examples.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
Community building and product development is of course key to the growth of an ecosystem.

However, the WAX Mainnet has become an extremely busy and demanding blockchain. A high level of performance hardware and operational experience are required to successfully run the platform and needed services, way beyond Block Production. High speed API’s and History solutions as an example.

I’d ask the OIG to continue evaluating what it takes to run effective infrastructre and services and then consider increasing the technology weighting in future evaluations.
