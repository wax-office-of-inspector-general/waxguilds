Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively

We have successfully indexed WAX on the new 3.3.4-rc7 version of Hyperion and are providing Full History V1/V2 for the WAX Mainnet. This history service is still very busy at the moment at around 30 to 200 requests / sec . It's also very disk consuming growing at 20 - 30GB / day .. we again added more disk this last month and an additional node.
https://wax.eosphere.io/v2/health

We also successfully expanded our Hyperion cluster to an additional Elasticsearch node, we will be using this modular approach to keeping up with the WAX History query and disk requirements.

As the previous month we have continued to run the cc32d9 v2.0.12wax01 WAX software and will consider going to the newer v2.1.0 enabled fork when available.

Currently our WAX Hyperion shows that it is missing block 1, however this is how a feeding state-history node presents block data. In Hyperion 3.3.5 release this has been taken into account so that it does not show as an error.
We will be upgrading when we are sure of the performance of 3.3.5. https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api/commit/1e79521cccde47d2803b4b4ca4e230d3993e4f12

We are also keeping up our WAX Snapshot Service.. and expect to expand it out for all other chains that we support.
http://snapshots.eosphere.io/

We have been been in the top #21 this month and are below the targeted 0.35ms median and our reliability is 99.999%.

### Monitoring and Alerts Platform
We are still in the development stages of our WAX Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts Platform that is specifically built for Guild’s operating a large footprint of WAX nodes.

I can share with you that we are calling the new platform **HeadsUp** and it is being built to privately monitor and alert operators on events in relation to:
- EOSIO Nodeos
- Atomic API
- Hyperion History

This month work was done on making the frontend modular and finalising the logo. The backend polling and alerting engine which worked great in our own PoC is now being packaged up in a docker container for easy deployment. Appropriate API’s are being developed and made available in the backend for the frontend to glean relevant statistics and information.

We are very excited about sharing what we are creating, it’s just going to take a bit more time for it to be ready for release.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

### emanate
We have been partners with emanate (https://emanate.live) since 2018 , if you weren’t already aware emanate is a music contacts platform with 1000’s of real world artists already signed up .. including deadmau5 and Goldilox. In conversations with Sean Gardener the CEO, we have influenced the team to make use of the WAX Protocol network’s ability to support NFT’s and a digital marketplace.

We have previously brokered very positive conversations between wax.io and Emanate, which has eventuated in the release of a deadmau5: Series 1 NFT launched out of the Emanate RAREZ™ brand

RAREZ™ is a new brand that has been created by Blockchain Music Pty Ltd (Emanate) for NFT collectibles. RAREZ aims to bring scarce digital collectables, digital music releases and other blockchain-based assets to the music industry.

This month deadmau5 and RAREZ™ kicked it into gear by launching deadmau5: Series 2 NFT Collectables.

The sale was concluded, however you can still purchase Individual Collectibles and unopened Standard and Mega Packs off AtomicHub for some very reasonable market prices.

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

We are currently building RAREZ for/with Emanate! Look out for a mobile app in the near future ;)

We had 1 x 30min consultation this month (Thanks to a pointer from David Kim).. that turned into multiple meetings, these were specifically in regards to launching NFT Collectables on WAX .. 
An Australian physical collectables and branding company is interested in launching NFT's for their clients.
This will be excellent mainstream exposure of household brands on WAX and rewired.one have the skills and demonstrable ability to enable them. As we progress through finalising an engagement model, we will keep you in the loop. 

We are also still mid contract for a private chain specifically in the resources space… perhaps NFT’s will be a requirement in the future.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing
We publish our Monthly community update regularly in the EOSphere Blog and advertise across our applicable socials.

We are active on our twitter feed with over 5,000 followers and are absolutely a strong marketing and engagement channel for WAX

### WAX Technical How To
We continue to publish a series of articles called “WAX Technical How To”. 

The #1 edition started with the basics of setting up a WAX Testnet Node.
Set Up a WAX Testnet Node -> https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-1-4cc5c9aa8d4e

Last month we published the #2 edition that covers the topic of Wax Snapshots.
How to use WAX Snapshots -> https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-2-db45a339e735

This month we published the #3 edition which walks through the process of building and registering a Block Producer on the WAX Testnet
Set Up a WAX Testnet Block Producer Node -> https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-3-78d358c46146

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. Below are a few examples.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
Community building and product development is of course key to the growth of an ecosystem.

However, the WAX Mainnet has become an extremely busy and demanding blockchain. A high level of performance hardware and operational experience are required to successfully run the platform and needed services, way beyond Block Production. High speed API’s and History solutions as an example.

I’d ask the OIG to continue evaluating what it takes to run effective infrastructre and services and then consider increasing the technology weighting in future evaluations.
