Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively

We have upgraded our Testnet infrastructure to the test ```v2.0.13wax02patch20210909``` release even though we haven't had any issues with "comas" once we are confident in it's stability we will move to the new release when available.

We are also quite pleased with the performance of our Hyperion service since moving to a multi-node ElasticSearch Cluster, we are seamlessly handling a constant 40 - 80 requests / second

Currently our WAX Hyperion shows that it is missing block 1, however this is how a feeding state-history node presents block data. In Hyperion 3.3.5 release this has been taken into account so that it does not show as an error.
We will be upgrading when we are sure of the performance of 3.3.5. https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api/commit/1e79521cccde47d2803b4b4ca4e230d3993e4f12

As the previous month we have continued to run the cc32d9 v2.0.12wax01 WAX software and will consider going to the newer v2.0.13 or v2.1.0 enabled fork when available.

We are also keeping up our WAX Snapshot Service.. and expect to expand it out for all other chains that we support.

This month we are sort of happy to report that we have at least achieved Three 9’s (99.92%) of Block Production Reliability, as well as a healthy Median 0.261ms Block Production Execution Speed. We dropped 205 blocks this month and a completely uncharacteristic 16 Rounds! This was of course due to the global OVH outage which has made us reconsider our multi provider strategy even though we are in multi regions.

### Monitoring and Alerts Platform
We are still in the development stages of our WAX Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts Platform that is specifically built for Guild’s operating a large footprint of WAX nodes.
I can now at last share the final HeadsUp logo with you:

The **HeadsUp** platform is being built to privately monitor and alert operators starting with WAX on events in relation to:
- EOSIO Nodeos
- Atomic API
- Hyperion History

This month the production engine and API’s have been finalised and work continues on presenting this information to the GUI frontend.

We are very excited about sharing what we are creating, it’s just taking time for it to be production ready for release.

### emanate
We have been partners with emanate (https://emanate.live) since 2018 , if you weren’t already aware emanate is a music contacts platform with 1000’s of real world artists already signed up .. including deadmau5 and Goldilox. In conversations with Sean Gardener the CEO, we have influenced the team to make use of the WAX Protocol network’s ability to support NFT’s and a digital marketplace.

We have previously brokered very positive conversations between wax.io and Emanate, which has eventuated in the release of a deadmau5: Series 1 NFT launched out of the Emanate RAREZ™ brand

RAREZ™ is a new brand that has been created by Blockchain Music Pty Ltd (Emanate) for NFT collectibles. RAREZ aims to bring scarce digital collectables, digital music releases and other blockchain-based assets to the music industry.

In September deadmau5 and RAREZ™ kicked it into gear by launching deadmau5: Series 2 NFT Collectables.

The sale was concluded, however you can still purchase Individual Collectibles and unopened Standard and Mega Packs off AtomicHub for some very reasonable market prices.

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

We are currently building RAREZ for/with Emanate! Look out for a mobile app in the near future ;)

We are still talking to a potential client (Thanks to a pointer from David Kim).. specifically in regards to launching NFT Collectables on WAX .. 
An Australian physical collectables and branding company is interested in launching NFT's for their clients.
This will be excellent mainstream exposure of household brands on WAX and rewired.one have the skills and demonstrable ability to enable them. As we progress through negotiating an engagement model, we will keep you in the loop. 

We are also still mid contract for a private chain specifically in the resources space… perhaps NFT’s will be a requirement in the future.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. Below are a few examples.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
I'm quite happy with the proposed 6 week OIG period between evaluations, certainly helps with the bit of effort submissions take.

And of course the usual chestnet, WAX Technical delivery is import for the hygiene of the network.. please keep up the point weight for Guilds that deliver solid services.
