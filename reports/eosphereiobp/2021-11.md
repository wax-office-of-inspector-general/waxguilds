Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively

We have upgraded our Testnet infrastructure to the test ```v2.1.0wax01``` release, this will be tested for a few weeks and then adopted on our mainnet nodes.

We are still very happy with the performance of our Hyperion service since moving to a multi-node ElasticSearch Cluster, we are seamlessly handling a constant 60 - 260 requests / second

When comparing to the previous month you can see disk space is being consumed quite rapidly, our expansion plan is to add an additional node when the time come.. this will also help balnce out the shard overhead.

Currently our WAX Hyperion shows that it is missing block 1, however this is how a feeding state-history node presents block data. In Hyperion 3.3.5 release this has been taken into account so that it does not show as an error.
We will be upgrading when we are sure of the performance of 3.3.5. https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api/commit/1e79521cccde47d2803b4b4ca4e230d3993e4f12
Advice from Igor is to still wait until he is happy with 3.3.5 for production.

As the previous month we have continued to run the cc32d9 v2.0.12wax01 WAX software and will consider going to v2.1.0 after testnet.

We’ve also been experimenting with new CPU architecture, specifically current gen AMD CPU’s for Block Production. I’ll hopefully have successful news to share with you in the future.

We've started rolling out the tmpfs node memory management strategy specifically dealing with nodeos state files.. it's going to save our disks and provide better user performance.

We are also keeping up our WAX Snapshot Service.. and expect to expand it out for all other chains that we support.

This month we are sort of happy to report that we have at least achieved Three 9’s (99.97%) of Block Production Reliability, as well as a healthy Median 0.258ms Block Production Execution Speed. We dropped 72 blocks this month and 6 Rounds. Due to a DDoS attack on one of our internet gateways.

### Monitoring and Alerts Platform
We are still in the development stages of our WAX Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts Platform that is specifically built for Guild’s operating a large footprint of WAX nodes.
Below are a few screenshots of the GUI .. however most of the work is still hapopening on the production engine.

![headsup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12730423/143667293-8b809bd9-8799-4af2-8b68-eb2a2ba29e5b.jpg)


The **HeadsUp** platform is being built to privately monitor and alert operators starting with WAX on events in relation to:
- EOSIO Nodeos
- Atomic API
- Hyperion History

This month work has continued on the production engine and allowing the node operator variables to be configured via the GU

We are very excited about sharing what we are creating, it’s just taking time for it to be production ready for release.

### emanate
We have been partners with emanate (https://emanate.live) since 2018 , if you weren’t already aware emanate is a music contacts platform with 1000’s of real world artists already signed up .. including deadmau5 and Goldilox. In conversations with Sean Gardener the CEO, we have influenced the team to make use of the WAX Protocol network’s ability to support NFT’s and a digital marketplace.

We have previously brokered very positive conversations between wax.io and Emanate, which has eventuated in the release of a deadmau5: Series 1 NFT launched out of the Emanate RAREZ™ brand

RAREZ™ is a new brand that has been created by Blockchain Music Pty Ltd (Emanate) for NFT collectibles. RAREZ aims to bring scarce digital collectables, digital music releases and other blockchain-based assets to the music industry.

In September deadmau5 and RAREZ™ kicked it into gear by launching deadmau5: Series 2 NFT Collectables.

The sale was concluded, however you can still purchase Individual Collectibles and unopened Standard and Mega Packs off AtomicHub for some very reasonable market prices.

Also RAREZ™ OG Badges have bneen launched, which give you access to NFT drops and regular entry to competitions. Of course they are also available on AtomicHub .. some more valuable than others

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

We are currently building RAREZ for/with Emanate! Look out for a mobile app in the near future ;)

We are still talking to a potential client (Thanks to a pointer from David Kim).. specifically in regards to launching NFT Collectables on WAX .. 
An Australian physical collectables and branding company is interested in launching NFT's for their clients.
This will be excellent mainstream exposure of household brands on WAX and rewired.one have the skills and demonstrable ability to enable them. As we progress through negotiating an engagement model, we will keep you in the loop. 

We are also still mid contract for a private chain specifically in the resources space… perhaps NFT’s will be a requirement in the future.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

We released two articles this month, both of which actually got the attention of HAProxy Technologies:

The #6 edition expands on the HAProxy configuration to mitigate API abuse.

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

Also I thought it would cool to share some of our medium stats which have really started to grow since we commenced building the WAX Technical How To articles

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. Below are a few examples.
