## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively.

We have upgraded WAX Hyperion service to v3.3.5 as well as upgraded ElasticSearch to 7.16.2 which will address any concerns with the Log4j Vulnerability. This upgrade of Hyperion will patch the issue of "last_indexed_block" not matching "total_indexed_blocks" causing an issue on some dashboards.

We are still very happy with the performance of our Hyperion service since moving to a multi-node ElasticSearch Cluster, we are seamlessly handling a constant 40 - 200 requests / second

When comparing to the previous month you can see disk space is still being consumed quite rapidly, our expansion plan is to add an additional node when the time comes (probably in March).. this will also help balance out the shard overhead.

We are currently running the cc32d9 v2.0.13wax01 WAX software and won't be moving to v2.1.x in production considering some of the discussion/changes to the EOSIO code base direction

After successfully experimenting with new AMD Ryzen CPU architecture, we have moved block production of our Mainnet and Testnet Producers to this new infrastructre. The result are fantastic.

We've rolled out the tmpfs node memory management strategy specifically dealing with nodeos state files across our WAX nodeos servers, with no apparent downside. Will report back if any issues are experienced.

We have increased the retenion in our WAX Snapshot Service (3 Months / 1 snap per day).

This month we very chuffed to report that we have at least achieved 100% of Block Production Reliability, as well as an awesome Median of 0.174ms Block Production Execution Speed.

After discussion with the OIG this month we have added an additional layer of global (4 Regions Across the Globe) external monitoring/alerting of our advertising and services being advertised.

You can see the Hyperion Maintenance window being reflected.

Our chains.json points to:

mainnet bp.json .. https://eosphere.io/wax/bp.json

testnet bp.json .. https://www.eosphere.io/waxtestnet/bp.json

We are providing an API for the Atomic Assets service:

https://wax-atomic-api.eosphere.io/atomicmarket/docs/

https://wax-atomic-api.eosphere.io/atomicassets/docs/

This last month we have added a **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** as an additional useful API offering. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12730423/149069859-c21739dc-6835-4d6a-9c39-3cf479ff2841.png)

This service can be used to restore a WAX Full Hyperion Service from scratch in as quick as 3 days. (Currently this takes 2 Months+ to index from chain)
At the moment the ElastcSearch database is around 9TB and we have successfuly restored 4 Guild Hyperion offerings. 

This offering is also free to use right now, but will require FW permission to access. I have been advertising to the Guilds in telegram .. with great uptake and feedback so far.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### Monitoring and Alerts Platform
We are still in the development stages of our WAX Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts Platform that is specifically built for Guild’s operating a large footprint of WAX nodes.

This last month much of the work has been on the node querying “ingestor”. It is crucial that the ingestor clearly communicates to the frontend dashboard and can connect and recover from a disconnection. Once this operation is perfected adding all the stats that we are after will be a simple task.

You can view a very brief video of the most basic functionality in action here -> https://youtu.be/wfqLep3YGuE

The **HeadsUp** platform is being built to privately monitor and alert operators starting with WAX on events in relation to:
- EOSIO Nodeos
- Atomic API
- Hyperion History

This backend operation is taking our dev’s a bit of time and is slowing down the cool stuff to be added to the dashboard.. which is coming soon!

### emanate
We have been partners with emanate (https://emanate.live) since 2018 , if you weren’t already aware emanate is a music contacts platform with 1000’s of real world artists already signed up .. including deadmau5 and Goldilox. In conversations with Sean Gardener the CEO, we have influenced the team to make use of the WAX Protocol network’s ability to support NFT’s and a digital marketplace.

We have previously brokered very positive conversations between wax.io and Emanate, which has eventuated in the release of a deadmau5: Series 1 NFT launched out of the Emanate RAREZ™ brand

RAREZ™ is a new brand that has been created by Blockchain Music Pty Ltd (Emanate) for NFT collectibles. RAREZ aims to bring scarce digital collectables, digital music releases and other blockchain-based assets to the music industry.

In September deadmau5 and RAREZ™ kicked it into gear by launching deadmau5: Series 2 NFT Collectables.

The sale was concluded, however you can still purchase Individual Collectibles and unopened Standard and Mega Packs off AtomicHub for some very reasonable market prices.

Also RAREZ™ OG Badges have been launched, which give you access to NFT drops and regular entry to competitions. Of course they are also available on AtomicHub .. prices appear to be doing well.

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

We are currently building RAREZ for/with Emanate! Look out for a mobile app in the near future ;)

We are now also in discussions with a WAX dApp game.. who are looking for Atomic API type specific statistics from their game .. 

We love working with the gaming dev community, we will keep you updated on how it goes.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. Below are a few examples.
