# EOSphere Guild February 2022 OIG Submission

In this submission under the guidance from the OIG in the Governance channel, I will only be providing updated or changed information. Normal technical requirements that will be gathered by the OIG anyway won't take up space in this submission.  

## What is the name of your Guild?

### EOSphere

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively other than our Hyperion public service.

Our public Hyperion service has been bent and then broken by the shear number of queries. Our cluster is fully modular and should be easily upgradable however supply chain issues have effected us recieving new NVMe storgae cards. I believe we are still a few weeks out from full service restoration.   

We also had an increase in requests on our Atomic API Service (Farmers World Market Queries), it was an issue for a few days until we upgraded our infrastructre and implemented new code by Pink.gg

We are currently hovering around 100 Atomic API requests / second and managing fine.

Our **Snapshot Web Server** has been expanded to provide the complete gambit of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/

In January we have added a **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** as an additional useful API offering.

This service has been very successful and the community usage has been even more than I expected. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API

This offering is still free to use right now.

This month we also launched our **WAX Testnet Hyperion Full History** which should assist those developing and testing their DApps on WAX technology. One more thing this cluster is running on shiny new Elasticsearch 8.0 ->

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### Monitoring and Alerts Platform
We are still in the development stages of our WAX Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts Platform that is specifically built for Guild’s operating a large footprint of WAX nodes.

This month focus was on ensuring that the platform's modularity is rock solid. An operator will be able to add and remove any metrics and thresholds directly in the web frontend.

You can view the latest video of the modular functionality in action here -> https://youtu.be/aKIOCnwJr9M

The **HeadsUp** platform is being built to privately monitor and alert operators starting with WAX on events in relation to:
- EOSIO Nodeos
- Atomic API
- Hyperion History

We are getting there!

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere are now offering **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**.

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community.

### emanate
We have been partners with emanate (https://emanate.live) since 2018 , if you weren’t already aware emanate is a music contacts platform with 1000’s of real world artists already signed up .. including deadmau5 and Goldilox. In conversations with Sean Gardener the CEO, we have influenced the team to make use of the WAX Protocol network’s ability to support NFT’s and a digital marketplace.

We have previously brokered very positive conversations between wax.io and Emanate, which has eventuated in the release of a deadmau5: Series 1 NFT launched out of the Emanate RAREZ™ brand

RAREZ™ is a new brand that has been created by Blockchain Music Pty Ltd (Emanate) for NFT collectibles. RAREZ aims to bring scarce digital collectables, digital music releases and other blockchain-based assets to the music industry.

In September deadmau5 and RAREZ™ kicked it into gear by launching deadmau5: Series 2 NFT Collectables.

The sale was concluded, however you can still purchase Individual Collectibles and unopened Standard and Mega Packs off AtomicHub for some very reasonable market prices.

Also RAREZ™ OG Badges have been launched, which give you access to NFT drops and regular entry to competitions. Of course they are also available on AtomicHub .. prices appear to be doing well.

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

We are currently still building RAREZ for/with Emanate!

We love working with the gaming dev community, we will keep you updated on how it goes.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

Also again I thought it would cool to share some of our current medium stats which I love.

One more thing to mention, I see our articles being used more and more by the community as well as other Guilds referencing them in their community platforms which is certainly flattering.

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. Below are a few examples.
