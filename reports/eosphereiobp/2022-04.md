# EOSphere Guild April 2022 OIG Submission

In this submission as before under the guidance from the OIG in the Governance channel, I will only be providing updated or changed information. Normal technical requirements that will be gathered by the OIG anyway won't take up space in this submission.  

## What is the name of your Guild?

### EOSphere

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively other than our Hyperion public service, which is still only available internally.

We had an ISP issue on the 9th and 10th of April where we missed 3 rounds. This is quite uncharacteristic of us. We have made a few changes to how we peer, which appears to have mitigated the issue.

We are a few weeks away from full restoration of the Hyperion service as we have decided to build a new cluster. The good news is all the hardware we have been waiting for has arrived. Mainly NVMe SSD's

This batch of hardware will also be used to expand our peer and API services.

Our **Atomic API Service** after the tweeks configured to mitigate Farmers World markets appear to still be working correctly and we are easily managing 100 - 150 queries / second

Our **Snapshot Web Server** was been expanded to provide the complete gambit of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/
This servcies is well used.

If you recall in  January we added a **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** as an additional useful API offering. This month we will expand to encompass the WAX Testnet.

This service has been very successful and the community usage has been even more than I expected. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API

This offering is still free to use right now and I'm considering moving it to ElasticSearch 8.0, probably stopping the regular snaps on ElasticSearch 7.16

### Monitoring and Alerts Platform
We are now in the MVP Alpha stage of HeadsUp our WAX Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts Platform. It’s really starting to come together and I have been very happy with the teams progress.

The **HeadsUp** platform is being built to privately monitor and alert operators starting with WAX on events in relation to:
- EOSIO Nodeos
- Atomic API
- Hyperion History

This months focus in on alerting and GUI views of specific metrics from nodeos, hyperion and atomic api.

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere are now offering **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**.

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community.

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

We are currently still building RAREZ for/with Emanate!

We love working with the gaming dev community, we will keep you updated on how it goes.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

Guilds are still referencing these articles in their community platforms which is awesome.
