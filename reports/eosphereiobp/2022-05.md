# EOSphere Guild May 2022 OIG Submission

In this submission as before under the guidance from the OIG in the Governance channel, I will only be providing updated or changed information. Normal technical requirements that will be gathered by the OIG anyway won't take up space in this submission.  

## What is the name of your Guild?

### EOSphere

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively.

We are happy to report that our long overdue hardware arrived, enabling us to build our new Hyperion Cluster as well as build additional API nodes.

Our Mainnet **WAX Hyperion Full History Service** V1/V2 is now backed by a cluster of 4 ElasticSearch 8.2 nodes built on modern enterprise hardware.

This cluster has been built with modularity and scalability in mind so on the next occasion we will have enough runway to upgrade when the time arrives.

Currently serving 50 - 500 requests per second and managaging quite well.

We have also launched a **WAX Testnet Hyperion Full History Service** V1/V2 to aid developers and operators with testing. It’s not a massive deployment compared to Mainnet but will certainly work as described.

Our **Snapshot Web Server** was been expanded to provide the complete gambit of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/
- nodeos snapshots
- nodeos blocks
- Atomic API backups
- Hyperion ES snapshots

This service is well used.

If you recall in  January we added a **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** as an additional useful API offering. We have now expanded this offering to encompass the WAX Testnet.

This service has been very successful and the community usage has been even more than I expected. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API

This offering is still free to use right now, next month we will be moving it to ElasticSearch 8.0.

We have upgraded our **testnet infrastructure to v2.0.14wax01** as well as enabled subjective billing and a 60min decay for testing. When successfull we will upgrade our mainnet infrastructure.

Our Mainnet and Tetsnet bp.json files have been amended to the updated v1.0.2 schema and have now incorportated the "full: true/false" field.

Lastly on the technical side we are often asked whether XYZ EOSphere WAX service is available, to provide transparency of our service availability we now offer a **WAX Public Facing Service Dashboard** https://wax.status.eosphere.io/

This rolling 2 hour view is built out of constructed queries from multiple global regions (California, Montreal, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney) and will provide a quick and realistic view on our WAX public services status.

### Monitoring and Alerts Platform
We are still in the MVP Alpha stage of HeadsUp our WAX Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts Platform.

This last sprint had the team troubleshooting CPU utilisation brought on by querying numerous nodes (some with high latency) and then feeding data from the ingestor to the dashboard. Happy to report that this is now resolved.

The complete compliment of nodeos/atomic/hyperion queries have also now been added as well as alerting functionality (slack and email)

This next sprint is on finalising the UI to ensure all this cool detail can effectively be view and alerted on.

I am optimistic that we will have a packaged up MVP in this next cycle that we will release to interested infrastructure community members for public testing.

The **HeadsUp** platform is being built to privately monitor and alert operators starting with WAX on events in relation to:
- EOSIO Nodeos
- Atomic API
- Hyperion History

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere offer **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**. 

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community.

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

We are currently still building RAREZ for/with Emanate!

We love working with the gaming dev community, we will keep you updated on how it goes.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing

We continue to publish a series of articles called **“WAX Technical How To”**. 

**This month we added #13 and #14**

The 13th edition details routing of specific API queries in HAProxy
How to route specific API queries between nodes -> https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-13-448b3375516

The 14th edition walks through an HAProxy example of managing websocket connections needed for WAX SHIP nodes.
How to Configure Websocket Support on a WAX Load Balancer -> https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-14-b8912d3ba1ef

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

We are still getting some good engagment on on our articles

Guilds are still referencing these articles in their community platforms which is awesome.

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. Below are a few examples.
