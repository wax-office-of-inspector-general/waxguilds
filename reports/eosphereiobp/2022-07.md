# EOSphere Guild July 2022 OIG Submission

In this submission as before under the guidance from the OIG in the Governance channel, I will only be providing updated or changed information. Normal technical requirements that will be gathered by the OIG anyway won't take up space in this submission.  

## What is the name of your Guild?

### EOSphere

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively.

We had some drama on the 7th of July for a period of 12 hours, we experienced a large increase of API requests causing our public nodes to slow down enough to cause a service disruption.

This was mitigated by adding an additional public API, that hardware was cheekily snatched from the old WAX Hyperion cluster.

We offer a **WAX Hyperion Full History Service** for WAX Mainnet and Testnet.

Our WAX Mainnet McDAddy Elasticsearch Cluster is running exceptionally well and still serves between 50 - 500 request pers second.

Our **Snapshot Web Server** has a full offering of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/
- nodeos snapshots
- nodeos blocks
- Atomic API backups
- Hyperion ES snapshots

Our **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** Mainnet and Testnet is also well used, saving time and effort in deploying Full History services on WAX. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API

Lastly just a reminder on the technical side that we provide transparency of our service availability through in **WAX Public Facing Service Dashboard** https://wax.status.eosphere.io/

This rolling 2 hour view is built out of constructed queries from multiple global regions (California, Montreal, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney) and will provide a quick and realistic view on our WAX public services status.

### Monitoring and Alerts Platform
We are still in the MVP Alpha stage of HeadsUp our WAX Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts Platform. We are optimistic that HeadsUp will be released into the wild in a few weeks.

Below is a short demo of HeadsUp’s basic functionality. Each screen is customisable to visually display relevant information, alerting is then also customisable.

Alerts are currently available on the dashboard, via email and in a slack channel.

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere offer **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**. 

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community.

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

We are currently still building RAREZ for/with Emanate!

We love working with the gaming dev community, we will keep you updated on how it goes.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing

### WAX Technical How To
We continue to publish a series of articles called **“WAX Technical How To”**. 

**This month we added #15.1 and #15.2**

This month and marks the start of our Hyperion Full History Technical How To Series. This series will cover the whole box and dice of a production Hyperion Full History Service, everything from Theory to Deployment and Operation.

Introduction to WAX Hyperion Full History -> https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-15-1-d2936d3c58d4

The 15.1 sub article explains the building blocks and concepts of the Hyperion Full History Service.

Build WAX Hyperion Software Components -> https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-15-2-a042ea8bc4b4

The 15.2 sub article walks through the process of building each component of the Hyperion Full History Service.

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

Guilds are still referencing these articles in their community platforms and WAX Developer (https://developer.wax.io/) have started building documention using these articles as a source.

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. Below are a few examples.
