# EOSphere Guild August 2022 OIG Submission

In this submission as before under the guidance from the OIG in the Governance channel, I will only be providing updated or changed information. Normal technical requirements that will be gathered by the OIG anyway won't take up space in this submission.  

## What is the name of your Guild?

### EOSphere

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively.

We had some drama on the network from the 29th August as did all Guilds, we have been actively participating in applying suggested mitigations and are on standby.

Our Peer1 Seed Node has been upgraded to Serve the huge amount of public peers, there was a blip on the validationcore page that should now be sorted.

If you have read our August Guild update you will see that we have in depth statistics from our WAX HAProxy deployment using Elastic Stack, logging all Normal API and Hyperion API calls. Some interesting stats below:
- 95% of Requests are Normal API, 4.8% are Hyperion API
- 60 to 70 Million HTTP "200"`s served per day
- More than 1 Billion Requests this last two weeks

This last week we have also upgraded our Testnet deployment to Leap ```v3.1.0wax01``` and will monitor .. this upgrade was also the reason why we missed 3 testnet rounds due to human error on our part.

We offer a **WAX Hyperion Full History Service** for WAX Mainnet and Testnet. Our Full History Service is Bad Ass.

Our **Snapshot Web Server** has a regular full offering of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/
- nodeos snapshots
- nodeos blocks
- Atomic API backups
- Hyperion ES snapshots

Our **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** Mainnet and Testnet is still well used, saving time and effort in deploying Full History services on WAX. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API

A reminder on the technical side that we provide transparency of our service availability through in **WAX Public Facing Service Dashboard** https://wax.status.eosphere.io/

This rolling 2 hour view is built out of constructed queries from multiple global regions (California, Montreal, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney) and will provide a quick and realistic view on our WAX public services status.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### HeadsUp Monitoring and Alerts Platform
Wow, yes we are getting there! Mark on our team has been closing issues like a machine. We are optimistic that HeadsUp will be released into the wild in a few weeks.

We are deploying a sentry server today in the DC next to our working HeadsUp instance so the team can gather stats.

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere offer **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**. 

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community. We have added our service to WaxZilla.

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

We are currently still building RAREZ for/with Emanate!

We love working with the gaming dev community, we will keep you updated on how it goes.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing
We publish our Monthly community update regularly in the EOSphere Blog and advertise across our applicable socials.

### Twitter
We are active on our twitter feed with over 5,000 followers and are absolutely a strong marketing and engagement channel for WAX https://twitter.com/eosphere_io.

### WAX Technical How To
We continue to publish a series of articles called **“WAX Technical How To”**. 

**This month we added #15.3 and #15.4**

This Hyperion Full History series will cover the whole box and dice of a production Hyperion Full History Service, everything from Theory to Deployment and Operation.

Configure WAX Hyperion Full History -> https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-15-3-b188c6aa9d12

The 15.3 sub article walks through specific configuration of each component of the Hyperion Full History Service.

Running WAX Hyperion Full History -> https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-15-4-f735d4cbc197

The 15.4 sub article explains how to actually run the Hyperion Full History Service.

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

Guilds are still referencing these articles in their community platforms and the feedback we recived certainly makes it worth it. Take a look at the engagement on medium:

All our Technical How To's are being converted and added to WAX Developer Github (https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/wax-developer) 

We have meet with IG Rakeden and have started the process of converting these articles into Github for the OIG as per request last month, we'd appreciate if the OIG would consider awarding us points for this.

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. Below are a few examples.
