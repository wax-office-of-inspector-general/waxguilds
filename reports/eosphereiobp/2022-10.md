# EOSphere Guild October 2022 OIG Submission

In this submission as before under the guidance from the OIG in the Governance channel, I will only be providing updated or changed information. Normal technical requirements that will be gathered by the OIG anyway won't take up space in this submission.  

## What is the name of your Guild?

### EOSphere

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively.

We had a slight blip on our Hyperion Mainnet service on the 7th of October where indexing of new blocks stopped, however history prior to this was still available.

We have added also upgraded two of our metal servers this month to newer generation hardware with more Memory and NVMe storage (Benefits of leasing equipmnet) , WAX really is a resouce intensive beast.

We will continue to provide in depth statistics from our WAX HAProxy deployment using Elastic Stack as this shows real usage and context to what our Guild provides. We are logging all Normal API and Hyperion API calls. Stats below with additional detail in our community monthly update:
- 98% of Requests are Normal API, 2% are Hyperion API
- 50 to 60 Million HTTP "200"`s served per day
- More than 750 Million Requests this last two weeks

We have strated rolling out Leap v3.1.x across mainnet, our BP, Blocks and Transaction Nodes have been upgraded first. I expect to complete the upgrade over the next period.

We still offer a **WAX Hyperion Full History Service** for WAX Mainnet and Testnet. Our Full History Service is very Bad Ass with close to 100% uptime.

Our **Snapshot Web Server** has a regular full offering of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/
- nodeos snapshots
- nodeos blocks
- Atomic API backups
- Hyperion ES snapshots

Our **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** Mainnet and Testnet is still well used, saving time and effort in deploying Full History services on WAX. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API

A reminder on the technical side that we provide transparency of our service availability through in **WAX Public Facing Service Dashboard** https://wax.status.eosphere.io/

This rolling 2 hour view is built out of constructed queries from multiple global regions (California, Montreal, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney) and will provide a quick and realistic view on our WAX public services status.

We are looking for Alpha Testers, and already have a couple. I'd also like to run the OIG through the platform working in our environment and provide access to the repo for full visability when you are ready.

The platform is open to anyone in our community, they just have to request access to the github repository.

We have also planned to continue longterm development of HeadsUp, fixing any issues and adding features. #exciting

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere offer **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**. 

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community. We have added our service to WaxZilla.

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. I believe our trip to Token2049 this month should deliver postive results as numerous leads were uncovered. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

We are currently still building RAREZ for/with Emanate!

We love working with the gaming dev community, we will keep you updated on how it goes.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing
We publish our Monthly community update regularly in the EOSphere Blog and advertise across our applicable socials.

### WAX Technical How To
We continue to publish a series of articles called **“WAX Technical How To”**. 

**This month we updated all EOSIO guides to cover the Updated Antelope Software + Current Requirements and an additional article has been added to the Hyperion Full History Technical How To Series #15.5.**

This Hyperion Full History series will covers the whole box and dice of a production Hyperion Full History Service, everything from Theory to Deployment and Operation.

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

Guilds are still referencing these articles in their community platforms and the feedback we recived certainly makes it worth it. Take a look at the latest engagement on medium:

We have continued to convert and add our guides to the WAX Developer Github (https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/wax-developer) 

This month we refreshed all existing articles and are following through the process with @Rakeden to get them all across.

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. However I see that there isn't an evaluation criteria for direct community assistance anymore so I haven't attached any specific examples as I have in the past.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
I appreciate the in depth review you are doing on Hyperion and recognising what it takes to run a quality Full History Service, keep up the great efforts OIG.
