# EOSphere Guild January 2023 OIG Submission

In this submission as before under the guidance from the OIG in the Governance channel, I will only be providing updated or changed information. Normal technical requirements that will be gathered by the OIG anyway won't take up space in this submission.  

## What is the name of your Guild?

### EOSphere

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively.

We will continue to provide in depth statistics from our WAX HAProxy deployment using Elastic Stack as this shows real usage and context to what our Guild provides. We are logging all Normal API and Hyperion API calls. Stats below with additional detail in our community monthly update:
- 96.13% of Requests are Normal API, 3.87% are Hyperion API
- 30 to 35 Million HTTP "200"`s served per day
- 450 Million Requests this last two weeks

We still offer a **WAX Hyperion Full History Service** for WAX Mainnet and Testnet. Our Full History Service Level is excellent with close to 100% uptime.

Our **Snapshot Web Server** has a regular full offering of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/
- nodeos snapshots
_These are now taken with Leap v3.1.x_
- nodeos blocks
- Atomic API backups
- Hyperion ES snapshots
_Mainnet Hyperion Snapshots scheduled to run daily_
- New this month we have added a **Full Mainnet State-History Backup** (7TB ouch) with corresponding Blocks and Snapshot

Our **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** Mainnet and Testnet is still well used (running off our new 64TB storage server), saving time and effort in deploying Full History services on WAX. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API

A reminder on the technical side that we provide transparency of our service availability through in **WAX Public Facing Service Dashboard** https://wax.status.eosphere.io/

This rolling 2 hour view is built out of constructed queries from multiple global regions (California, Montreal, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney) and will provide a quick and realistic view on our WAX public services status.

I'd still like to run the OIG through the platform working in our environment, although I see most of you have already joined the Telegram group. We would appredciate your feedback.

This next period we will be HeadsUp developmet focusing on:
- Multithreaded Ingestor Update
- Improvements to Hyperion Metrics and Alerts
- Improvements to Atomic API Metrics and Alerts
- Clean up of State-Database usage visualisation
- Other bugs and fixes

As metioned before we will continue longterm development of HeadsUp, fixing any issues and adding features each month. #exciting

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere offer **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**. 

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community. We have added our service to WaxZilla.

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements. Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. 
It has been tough going over the last few months though, prehaps the recent 
presumptive turn in the market will see businesses freeing up capital for blockchain developement?
We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing
We publish our Monthly community update regularly in the EOSphere Blog and advertise across our applicable socials.

### Twitter
We are active on our twitter feed with over 5,000 followers and are absolutely a strong marketing and engagement channel for WAX https://twitter.com/eosphere_io.

### WAX Technical How To
We regularly publish a series of articles called **“WAX Technical How To”**. 

**This last month we added a guide on how to build visability into your frontend infrastructre**

Get a that dreamy visibility of your HAProxy Frontend using Elasticsearch and Kibana.

How To Visualise Metrics from a WAX Load Balancer -> https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-16-a64d5a53d770

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

Guilds are still referencing these articles in their community platforms and the feedback we recived certainly makes it worth it. Take a look at the latest engagement on medium:

We have continued to convert and add our guides to the WAX Developer Github. (https://developer.wax.io/en/wax-infrastructure/) 

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. However I see that there isn't an evaluation criteria for direct community assistance anymore so I haven't attached any specific examples as I have in the past.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
We believe the base pay framework will go a long way to keeping Guild passion and healthy service delivery alive, keep up the great efforts OIG.
