# EOSphere Guild May 2023 OIG Submission

In this submission as before under the guidance from the OIG in the Governance channel, I will only be providing updated or changed information. Normal technical requirements that will be gathered by the OIG anyway won't take up space in this submission.  

## What is the name of your Guild?

### EOSphere

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively.

Our nodes across the board (Mainnet and Testnet) are in the process of being migrated to v4.0.1, our testnet is already running v4.0.0 however issues were encountered by us on other networks with this version halting deployment.

We gather in depth statistics from our WAX HAProxy deployment using Elastic Stack as this shows real usage and context to what our Guild provides. We are logging all Normal API and Hyperion API calls. Stats below with additional detail in our community monthly update:
- 96.72% of Requests are Normal API, 3.28% are Hyperion API
- 33 to 37 Million HTTP "200"`s served per day
- 520 Million Requests this last two weeks

We still offer a **WAX Hyperion Full History Service** for WAX Mainnet and Testnet. Our Full History Service Level is excellent with close to 100% uptime.

We have also been working with RIO Blocks on their new tool to ensure no blocks have missed being indexed, which has happened in the past. We will write an article on the procedure.

Our **Snapshot Web Server** has a regular full offering of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/
- nodeos snapshots
_These are with Leap v3.1.x_
- nodeos blocks
- Atomic API backups
- Hyperion ES snapshots
_Mainnet Hyperion Snapshots scheduled to run daily_
- Full Mainnet State-History Backup with corresponding Blocks and Snapshot

Our **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** Mainnet and Testnet is still very well used (running off our new 64TB storage server), saving time and effort in deploying Full History services on WAX. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API

A reminder on the technical side that we provide transparency of our service availability through our **WAX Public Facing Service Dashboard** https://wax.status.eosphere.io/

This rolling 2 hour view is built out of constructed queries from multiple global regions (California, Montreal, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney) and will provide a quick and realistic view on our WAX public services status.

### HeadsUp Monitoring and Alerts Platform
HeadsUp has started the development process of migrating the ingestor processes over to a Rust iteration.

v0.0.129 is the first version with Rust used for the “has produced” metric.

This new Rust version brings:
- Better Performance
- Better Memory Management
- Multithreading

The team has also been working on updating the metric and alerts settings interface hopefully to be merged into the next release, below is a demo:

Join the HeadsUp [Telegram Group](https://t.me/headsup_monitoring_alerts) or go straight to the [Public GitHub](https://github.com/eosphere/HeadsUp-Monitoring-Alerts)

The next release will add add the ability to simply turn on/off each individual alert as above and continue with the migration of services over to Rust.

We will continue longterm development of HeadsUp, fixing any issues and adding features each month.

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere offer **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**. 

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community. We have added our service to WaxZilla.

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements. Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. 
We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing
We publish our Monthly community update regularly in the EOSphere Blog and advertise across our applicable socials.

### Twitter

### WAX Technical How To
We regularly publish a series of articles called **“WAX Technical How To”**. 

**This month we created a detailed guide on using ZFS Deduplication to optimise disk space utilisation.**

How to make use of ZFS to mitigate high disk utilisation of /blocks and /state-history folders.

Optimse Disk Utilisation with ZFS Deduplication -> https://medium.com/eosphere/eosphere-guild-may-23-update-1bb153eeb1f2

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

Our Technical Articles were praised in the WAX Wednesday Twitter Space this month -> https://twitter.com/WAX_io/status/1661328357491974148?s=20

We have continued to convert and add our guides to the WAX Developer Github. (https://developer.wax.io/en/wax-infrastructure/) 

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. However I see that there isn't an evaluation criteria for direct community assistance anymore so I haven't attached any specific examples as I have in the past.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
Keep up the great efforts OIG, Go WAX token price!
