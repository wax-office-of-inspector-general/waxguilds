# EOSphere Guild July 2023 OIG Submission

In this submission as before under the guidance from the OIG in the Governance channel, I will only be providing updated or changed information. Normal technical requirements that will be gathered by the OIG anyway won't take up space in this submission.  

## What is the name of your Guild?

### EOSphere

## Monthly Requirement
### Hotfix Patch
EOSphere have 25 WAX Leap Software Nodes, we started rolling out the LEAP Hotfix on the 11th of July.

As I'm sure the OIG was aware this patch wasn't specifically built for the WAX Leap version and required some editing of the .diff to enable it to be compiled. 

There also wasn't a WAX version v4.0.3 and the patch had to be compiled over v4.0.1wax01

With this in mind we were cautious about blanket rolling it out across our Testnet and Mainnet nodes and instead deployed it on enough nodes to ensure if there was a network DDoS we would be in a position to continue providing service. 

On the 13th July the offical fixed v4.0.4wax01 was released and we have started rolling it out across all our nodes.

Testnet is 75% v4.0.4wax01 and Mainnet is 30% v4.0.4wax01

We expect to be completely upgraded to v4.0.4wax01 by the 19th July, however we are in safe position if there was an attack using the identified exploit.

### API Usage
We publish a commnunity update monthly with quite a few statistics, I will summerise WAX Mainnet API specific statistics from the last 24 hours (14th July) below:

- WAX Network Nodeos API -> 28 Million Served Requests / Day
- WAX Hyperion -> 1.5 Million Served Requests / Day
- WAX Atomic API -> 2 Million Served Requests / Day

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively.

We gather in depth statistics from our WAX HAProxy deployment using Elastic Stack as this shows real usage and context to what our Guild provides. We are logging all Normal API and Hyperion API calls. Stats below with additional detail in our community monthly update:
- 96.07% of Requests are Normal API, 3.93% are Hyperion API
- 24 to 31 Million HTTP "200"`s served per day
- 400 Million Requests this last two weeks

We still offer a **WAX Hyperion Full History Service** for WAX Mainnet and Testnet. Our Full History Service Level is excellent with close to 100% uptime.

We have been working with the EOS RIO Hyperion team on testing a new tool to repair missing blocks and incorrect indices on Hyperion. We are happy to report that our WAX Full History Service has been scanned and repaired (only a few errors were found) to ensure we do in fact provide a complete transactional history. 

This months WAX Technical How To covers usage of the Hyperion Repair Tool.

Our **Snapshot Web Server** has a regular full offering of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/
- nodeos snapshots
_These are currently with Leap v3.1.x and will soon be switched to v4.0.x_
- nodeos blocks
- Atomic API backups
- Hyperion ES snapshots
_Mainnet Hyperion Snapshots scheduled to run daily_
- Full Mainnet State-History Backup with corresponding Blocks and Snapshot

Our **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** Mainnet and Testnet is still very well used (running off our 64TB storage server), saving time and effort in deploying Full History services on WAX. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API

A reminder on the technical side that we provide transparency of our service availability through our **WAX Public Facing Service Dashboard** https://wax.status.eosphere.io/

This rolling 2 hour view is built out of constructed queries from multiple global regions (California, Montreal, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney) and will provide a quick and realistic view on our WAX public services status.

### HeadsUp Monitoring and Alerts Platform
HeadsUp has continued the development process of migrating the ingestor processes over to a Rust iteration. 

This move to Rust has given the platform a considerable performance increase.

v0.0.154 is now available and brings the following features:

- Better Performance
- Better Memory Management
- Multithreading
- An uprated Metric and Alerts selection interface
- Explanatory (?) on each metric
- Date and Time of Last Reward Claim
- Date and Time of Last Produced Block
- Various bug fixes and UI tweaks

The uprated Metric and Alerts Interface makes it even simpler for operators to choose Metrics and adjust Alerts as well as restore defaults with the click of a button.

In the next release we will be adding user set defaults.

Join the HeadsUp [Telegram Group](https://t.me/headsup_monitoring_alerts) or go straight to the [Public GitHub](https://github.com/eosphere/HeadsUp-Monitoring-Alerts)

We will continue longterm development of HeadsUp, fixing any issues and adding features each month.

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere offer **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**. 

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community. We have added our service to WaxZilla.

### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements. Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. 
We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing
We publish our Monthly community update regularly in the EOSphere Blog and advertise across our applicable socials.

**This month we created a usage guide on the EOS RIO Hyperion Index Repair Tool.**

How to ensure your WAX Hyperion Full History service is complete and healthy.

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

Below are the latest engagement stats from medium:

We have continued to convert and add our guides to the *New* Format WAX Developer Github. (https://developer.wax.io/operate/wax-infrastructure/) 

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members. However I see that there isn't an evaluation criteria for direct community assistance anymore so I haven't attached any specific examples as I have in the past.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
Keep up the great efforts OIG, Good Luck with the Elections.
