## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively.

However this month we had issues with both our Primary and Secondary WAX Block Production Servers. It started with a power failure on the 24th of August which appeared to have damaged our hardware as the Primary would then randomly reboot and the Secondary would just lock up after a period of time. 

This caused us to miss an uncharacteristic 17 Rounds (204 blocks) on WAX Mainnet, of course we are very quick to action and unregistered within minutes after each incident.

We have now provisioned a new Primary Server using an AMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU with ECC DDR5 RAM which has delivered stability and a performance boost in block signing times from the 27th August.

Something still had to be done in regards to our Secondary server, which is why we ordered new current gen hardware and will be deploying this backup in our Perth Australia Disaster Recover rack. Intel i9 13900K CPU with DDR5 RAM and top shelf AIO liquid cooling.

We gather in depth statistics from our WAX HAProxy deployment using Elastic Stack as this shows real usage and context to what our Guild provides. We are logging all Normal API and Hyperion API calls. Stats below with additional detail in our community monthly update:
- 95.77% of Requests are Normal API, 4.23% are Hyperion API
- 21 to 26 Million HTTP "200"`s served per day
- 370 Million Requests this last two weeks

We offer a **WAX Hyperion Full History Service** for WAX Mainnet and Testnet. Our Full History Service Level is excellent with close to 100% uptime.

With full history now 25.5TB in size, we have started using data tiering to move older less accessed data to storage focused nodes.

A reminder on the technical side that we provide transparency of our service availability through our **WAX Public Facing Service Dashboard** https://wax.status.eosphere.io/

This rolling 2 hour view is built out of constructed queries from multiple global regions (California, Montreal, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney) and will provide a quick and realistic view on our WAX public services status.

### HeadsUp Monitoring and Alerts Platform
HeadsUp has continued the development process of migrating the last remaining ingestor processes over to a Rust iteration. This move to rust has given the platform a considerable performance increase and will mean we leave Python behind in it’s entirety.

**v0.0.155 / 158** is now available and brings the following features:

- Fixes to the Vote Metric calculations and alert mechanics
- Fixes to the new Metrics and Alerts selection interface
- Rust framework standardisation
- Various bug fixes and UI tweaks

In the next release we hope to complete the Rust process migration, an update to a better alerts viewing interface and a change to alerts so as to make them clearer.

Join the HeadsUp [Telegram Group](https://t.me/headsup_monitoring_alerts) or go straight to the [Public GitHub](https://github.com/eosphere/HeadsUp-Monitoring-Alerts)

We will continue longterm development of HeadsUp, fixing any issues and adding features each month.

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere offer **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**. 

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community. We have added our service to WaxZilla.

Our **Snapshot Web Server** has a regular full offering of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/
- nodeos snapshots
- nodeos blocks
- Atomic API backups
- Hyperion ES snapshots
_Mainnet Hyperion Snapshots scheduled to run daily_
- Full Mainnet State-History Backup with corresponding Blocks and Snapshot
_Currently uploading one from this month to replace the one from earlier this year_

Our **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** Mainnet and Testnet is still very well used (running off our 64TB storage server), saving time and effort in deploying Full History services on WAX. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API


### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements. Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. 
We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing
We publish our Monthly community update regularly in the EOSphere Blog and advertise across our applicable socials.

### WAX Technical How To
We regularly publish a series of articles called **“WAX Technical How To”**. 

**This month we created a guide on how to setup an automated nodoes snapshot service.**

How to use a scripting method to automate the creation of nodeos snapshots.

Automate WAX Snapshots -> https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-19-6e4a9773c754

We will be regularly releasing Technical How To articles from beginner to advanced and expect this will assist new potential Guild candidates and developers to get started on the WAX Protocol Network.

Below are the latest engagement stats from medium:

We have continued to convert and add our guides to the *New* Format WAX Developer Github. (https://developer.wax.io/operate/wax-infrastructure/) 

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members.

Lately we have been working with Michael from EOSUSA on nodeos configuration documentation and config standardisation.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
Keep up the great efforts OIG, the parachute system has been very effective.
