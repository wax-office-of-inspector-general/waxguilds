# EOSphere Guild October 2023 OIG Submission

In this submission as before under the guidance from the OIG in the Governance channel, I will only be providing updated or changed information. Normal technical requirements that will be gathered by the OIG anyway won't take up space in this submission.  

## What is the name of your Guild?

### EOSphere

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Currently we are looking good with core infrastructure and services running effectively.

This last month we were effected by the Hyperion bug on the 25th September that forced us to upgrade to the latest code v3.3.9-8, we were upgraded and running normally within 8 hours of the issue being identified.

We also upgraded our Atomic Asset Service to v1.3.21 as requested.

We had on internet outage for 2.5mins causing us to miss 2 block production rounds on the 29th September, we were just about to switch to our newly built secondary node when production returned to normal.

We experienced a Hyperion querying issue on the 10th October, for some reason Hyperion v3.3.9-8 (perhaps a question on going with the latest "untested" version) was indexing blocks that wearnt querable for about 16 hours .. when this was discovered it was remediated with a catch-up overwite and the issue escalated to RIO Blocks. We will continue to monitor.

We gather in depth statistics from our WAX HAProxy deployment using Elastic Stack as this shows real usage and context to what our Guild provides. We are logging all Normal API and Hyperion API calls. Stats below with additional detail in our community monthly update:
- 95.37% of Requests are Normal API, 4.63% are Hyperion API
- 26 to 34 Million HTTP "200"`s served per day
- 430 Million Requests this last two weeks

We offer a **WAX Hyperion Full History Service** for WAX Mainnet and Testnet. Our Full History Service Level is excellent with close to 100% uptime.

With full history now 26.4TB in size.

A reminder on the technical side that we provide transparency of our service availability through our **WAX Public Facing Service Dashboard** https://wax.status.eosphere.io/

This rolling 2 hour view is built out of constructed queries from multiple global regions (California, Montreal, Frankfurt, Singapore, Sydney) and will provide a quick and realistic view on our WAX public services status.

### HeadsUp Monitoring and Alerts Platform
HeadsUp has just about completed the development process of migrating the last remaining ingestor processes over to a Rust iteration. 
This move to rust has given the platform a considerable performance increase and will mean we leave Python behind in it's entirety.

The next release of HeadsUp with be our first Beta v0.1 and will include the following features:
- Removal of the Python Ingestor Container in it's entirety
- All services migrated to Rust
- Update to the traffic light system on the Home and Chain Pages to reflect node state
- Complete GUI change and re-imagining of the alerts panel making it far simpler to view and silence alerts.

### Commercial Solutions for WAX Services
EOSphere offer **Commercial Solutions for WAX Services**. 

We are able to host or operate infrastructure for the following:

**Hyperion Full History**

**Atomic API**

**WAX Protocol Network API**

At this point we won't be providing this service to other Guilds. However they are still welcome to use our ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API free of charge.

Any interest has been asked to contact us at **info@eosphere.io** to discuss needs so we can craft a suitable solution. 

We'd also appreciate the OIG of keeping us in mind as they clearly hear requests from the community. We have added our service to WaxZilla.

Our **Snapshot Web Server** has a regular full offering of snapshots and backups http://snapshots.eosphere.io/
- nodeos snapshots
- nodeos blocks
- Atomic API backups
- Hyperion ES snapshots
_Mainnet Hyperion Snapshots scheduled to run daily_
- Full Mainnet State-History Backup with corresponding Blocks and Snapshot

Our **ElasticSearch Snapshot Repository API** Mainnet and Testnet is still very well used (running off our 64TB storage server), saving time and effort in deploying Full History services on WAX. You can join the service telegram group here -> https://t.me/EOSphere_ES_Snapshot_API


### rewired.one
We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business (https://www.rewired.one/)

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements. Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with the WAX business development team.

EOSphere and rewired.one are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. 
We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

### Marketing
We publish our Monthly community update regularly in the EOSphere Blog and advertise across our applicable socials.

### Community Assistance
As a veteran Guild EOSphere we are quite often working behind the scenes to assist other Guilds, DApps and community members.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
In regards to the v5.3 OIG Proposed Guidelines, I have the following comments:

**Subjective Guild Reviews**

It is important to incentivise the correct Guild performance behaviour with SLR’s, however demonstratively effective Guilds shouldn’t be egregiously punished especially for situations out of their control.

For example the minimum requirement of 98% Round and Block availability. Even if the Guild unregisters immediately or fails over to a backup node they may still fail this SLR as the nodeos code takes about 4-5 rounds to make the chain change. This is compounded when the issue occurs a couple times, even though the Guild is very active and trying to remediate.

We believe Guilds should be viewed with a degree of subjectivity by the OIG when it can be argued that a Guild is clearly engaged and remediating an issue out of their control. Especially in regards to an instant minimum requirements failure.

The code is always bleeding edge, things happen and engaged Guilds are constantly trying to improve.

**History-API Conditions**

Full history is very expensive to run and occationally Hyperion being soo bleeding edge may experience bugs.

We think the first low tier (70 - 95% / 1 point) Full History SLR should be changed to (80 - 90% /  2points) 

**Backups**

We believe the following backup SLR's are sufficent:

- Chain 0.5 1/day 30d ret
- AA 0.5 1/month 3m ret (Maybe a question for Wombat .. what woudl help them?)
- SH 0.5 1/6month 0 ret (Not as important as the blocks.log , but it's 8TB)
- blocks.log 0.5 1/month 0 ret
- ES 1.0 1/week 30d ret (Points for Full Backup)
