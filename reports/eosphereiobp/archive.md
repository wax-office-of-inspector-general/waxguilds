## June 2021

Happy June Ratings. Please find our updates below:

**Technical Operations:**

Currently we are looking good with core **infrastructure and services** running effectively... Increased load on the network created a need for us to systematically upgrade all hardware and internet services which has been a large piece of work but we are now successfully upgraded, and future proofed for another year .,. maybe ;)

I have started a new index of WAX on the new 3.3.4-rc1 version of Hyperion and expect to cutover to this new server this month. It also has shiney new NVMe cards.

This last month we have continued to run the cc32d9 **v2.0.12wax01** and will consider going to the newer v2.1.0 enabled fork when available.

We currently still provide **full history** via history-api (V1) and Hyperion (V2)

We are also keeping our WAX **snapshot service**.. and expect to expand it out for all other chains we support.

[https://snapshots.eosphere.io/](https://snapshots.eosphere.io/)

We are lucky enough to be bumped into the  maiannet #21 this month and produced for a few days, we are below the targeted **0.35ms median** and our reliability is within threshold.

We are however standby this month and are also below the targeted **0.35ms median** and our reliability is within threshold.

Our **chains.json** points to:

mainnet bp.json .. [https://eosphere.io/wax/bp.json](https://eosphere.io/wax/bp.json)

testnet bp.json .. [https://www.eosphere.io/waxtestnet/bp.json](https://www.eosphere.io/waxtestnet/bp.json)

We are providing an API for the **Atomic Assets** service, this of course is run out of our DC in Sydney, Australia:

[https://wax-atomic-api.eosphere.io/atomicassets/docs/](https://wax-atomic-api.eosphere.io/atomicassets/docs/)

**Product development:**

We currently do not have any specific WAX products in development, however we are now supporting the Atomic Assets API, Full History V1 + V2 and hosting API + P2P servers in Sydney Australia and Beauharnois Canada

**Business Development:**

emanate

We have been partners with emanate ([https://emanate.live](https://emanate.live/)) since 2018 , if you weren't already aware emanate is a music contacts platform with 1000's of real world artists already signed up .. including deadmau5 and Goldilox. In conversations with Sean Gardener the CEO, we have influenced the team to make use of the WAX Protocol network's ability to support NFT's and a digital marketplace. Emanate's music industry partners have been consulted and are onboard to create and market NFT's tied to artists and music (yes music enabled NFT's).

After the success of the world recognised Rock Band "Weezer"  NFT campaign, the team are looking to the next NFT Artist ..  I'm told it will still take a little while more. Obviously the plan is to keep pushing Artist NFT's through the Rarez brand.

RAREZ™ is a new brand that has been created by Blockchain Music Pty Ltd (Emanate) for the Series 1 collectibles. RAREZ aims to bring scarce digital collectables, digital music releases and other blockchain-based assets to the music industry.

We have previously brokered very positive conversations between [wax.io](http://wax.io/) and Emanate, which has eventuated in the release of a deadmau5 NFT event. The event was a complete success with all packs sold out and has genuinely brought many non-crypto users to the experience of NFTs.

[https://twitter.com/EmanateOfficial/status/1339774467313168384?s=20](https://twitter.com/EmanateOfficial/status/1339774467313168384?s=20)

As deadmau5 looks to take his shows into a dedicated VR world next year, his 20 million followers will start looking at digital merchants over physical merchandising and we have already made an impact to these fans by familiarising them with the WAX ecosystem. I honestly think this will be huge for the WAX Protocol Network and NFTs in general.

Emanate is also seriously considering moving more of their music service structure to WAX (This is absolutely a work in progress) , taking advantage of the Cloud Wallet and positive NFT community messaging. Right now there is some focus on designing and building a WAX Marketplace specifically for RAREZ™, however this is too soon to announce.. I will share details when the strategy is more solidified.

rewired.one

We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business ([https://www.rewired.one/](https://www.rewired.one/))

We are currently building RAREZ for/with Emanate! Look out for a mobile app in the near future ;)

We had 1 x 30min consultation this month, which wasn't specifically WAX .. however we are mid contract for a private chain specifically in the resources space... perhaps NFT's will be a requirement in the future.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with Jassy from WAX.

EOSphere and rewired.one (including our dfuse partnership / which will soon be superseded by an alternate) are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

**Community Engagement:**

We are active on our twitter feed with over 5,000 followers and are absolutely a strong marketing and engagement channel for WAX.

## May 2021

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

Currently we are looking good with core **infrastructure and services** running effectively... However, the increased load on the network has created a need for us to systematically upgrade all infrastructure which is a bit of a process and I believe we will be "full bottle" by the end of this month.

Of note, our Atomic API is constantly being DDoS'd which resulted in our internet provider sending me a few emails and our Hyperion disk array has been lagging (we seem to drop a few blocks randomly) . I have made arrangements for upgrading our internet capability and our Hyperion is about to move over to NVMe when the cards arrive.

Of course Block Production and public chain API's have not been affected.

This month we upgrade to the lasted cc32d9 **v2.0.12wax01**

We currently still provide **full history** via history-api (V1) and Hyperion (V2)

We are also keeping our WAX **snapshot service**.. and expect to expand it out for all other chains we support.

[https://snapshots.eosphere.io/](https://snapshots.eosphere.io/)

We are lucky enough to be in the #21 this month and producing, we are below the targeted **0.35ms median** and our reliability is within threshold.

Our **chains.json** points to:

mainnet bp.json .. [https://eosphere.io/wax/bp.json](https://eosphere.io/wax/bp.json)

testnet bp.json .. [https://www.eosphere.io/waxtestnet/bp.json](https://www.eosphere.io/waxtestnet/bp.json)

We are now providing an API for the **Atomic Assets** service, this of course is run out of our DC in Sydney, Australia:

[https://wax-atomic-api.eosphere.io/atomicassets/docs/](https://wax-atomic-api.eosphere.io/atomicassets/docs/)

As mentioned we are in the process of giving the Atomic Assets a more robust internet connection.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

We currently do not have any specific WAX products in development, however we are now supporting the Atomic Assets API, Full History V1 + V2 and hosting API + P2P servers in Sydney Australia and Beauharnois Canada

## April 2021

Happy #ToppsUsers April Ratings. Please find our updates below:

**Technical Operations:**

Currently we are looking good with **infrastructure and services** running effectively... except for our Atomic Assets API , which we are provisioning a new server for as it needs some proper single thread CPU performance.

The last week has been very challenging for our infrastructure, we were DDoS'd multiple times.. first on our public peers and then on our public API LB's. This has made John and I rethink the performance that WAX requires and we will be making infrastructure upgrades over the coming week/month.

Of course Block Production was never affected.

On another note, we are about to upgrade to the last cc32d9 **v2.0.12wax01** just need to test it a bit on the testnet.

We currently still provide **full history** via history-api (V1) and Hyperion (V2)

We are also keeping our WAX **snapshot service**.. and expect to expand it out for all other chains we support.

[https://snapshots.eosphere.io/](https://snapshots.eosphere.io/)

We are lucky enough to be in the #21 this month and producing, we are below the targeted **0.35ms median** and our reliability is within threshold.

Our **chains.json** points to:

testnet bp.json .. [https://www.eosphere.io/waxtestnet/bp.json](https://www.eosphere.io/waxtestnet/bp.json)

[https://wax-atomic-api.eosphere.io/atomicassets/docs/](https://wax-atomic-api.eosphere.io/atomicassets/docs/)

As mentioned we are in the process of giving the Atomic Assets more single threaded CPU performance (it is not keeping up) as it was already running on NVMe, it is currently not available.

**Product development:**

We currently do not have any specific WAX products in development, however we are now supporting the Atomic Assets API and hosting API servers in Sydney Australia.

Emanate's music industry partners have been consulted and are onboard to create and market NFT's tied to artists and music (yes music enabled NFT's).

Our next NFT driven through our Emanate Partnership is still coming, I actually thought it would be out by now. This time it's the world recognised Rock Band "Weezer" obviously pushed through the Rarez brand.

RAREZ™ is a new brand that has been created by Blockchain Music Pty Ltd (Emanate) for the Series 1 collectibles. RAREZ aims to bring scarce digital collectables, digital music releases and other blockchain-based assets to the music industry.

We had 5 x 30min consults this month, one which could be WAX Protocol Network suitable (Sport based NFT's)... and one that is going to be on FIO ;)

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :) Currently we are augmenting the Emanate dev team and are engaged with Jassy from WAX.

**Technical Operations:**

All looking great, **infrastructure and services** running effectively.

We **upgraded** to the cc32d9 wax2.0 v2.0.10wax01 eosio version and applied the B1 patch to fix the "enable-account-queries" bug.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

All looking great, infrastructure and services running effectively.

We recently upgraded our infra for public API servers.. so they are a bit more snappy.

We are still supporting Malatablock with their ZOS-IBC project and have brought EOSDT to WAX in order for dApps and services to leverage EOSDT. EOSphere are running one of the reporters to confirm IBC transactions along with Maltablock and AlohaEOS. Although not widely adopted as yet, this service still fills a gap in our networks' offerings.

The ability to enable dApps to provide a USD pricing option makes it simpler for new users to understand the value of their products and provides easier engagement for payments.. also having USD as a pegged asset provides users with an on network speculative option. We are pleased to bring this value to the WAX Protocol Network.

emanate

We have been partners with emanate ([https://emanate.live](https://emanate.live/)) since 2018 , if you weren't already aware emanate is a music contacts platform with 1000's of real world artists already signed up .. including deadmau5 and Goldilox. In conversations with Sean Gardener the CEO, we have influenced the team to make use of the WAX Protocol network's ability to support NFT's and a digital marketplace. Emanate's music industry partners have been consulted and are onboard to create and market NFT's tied to artists and music (yes music enabled NFT's).

We have brokered very positive conversations between [wax.io](http://wax.io/) and Emanate, which has eventuated in the release of a deadmau5 NFT event. The event was a complete success with all packs sold out and has genuinely brought many non-crypto users to the experience of NFTs.

[https://twitter.com/EmanateOfficial/status/1339774467313168384?s=20](https://twitter.com/EmanateOfficial/status/1339774467313168384?s=20)

As deadmau5 looks to take his shows into a dedicated VR world next year, his 20 million followers will start looking at digital merchants over physical merchandising and we have already made an impact to these fans by familiarising them with the WAX ecosystem. I honestly think this will be huge for the WAX Protocol Network and NFTs in general.

rewired.one

We are constantly looking to advise businesses and new dApps on the benefits of blockchain in the enterprise. WAX is a key network that we evangelise. We offer a free 30min consult in our rewired.one business ([https://www.rewired.one/](https://www.rewired.one/))

We had 1 x 30min consults this month, which may be WAX aligned with conversations continuing in the new year.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any future successful engagements :)

EOSphere and rewired.one (including our dfuse partnership) are in it for the win bringing mainstream adoption and enablement to our WAX world, the fact that we are engaging with the public and providing consultancy services at no cost shows our commitment to making this goal a reality. We believe the WAX network needs this service to attract dApps and that is why we are providing it.

Hi OIG!

Happy November Ratings. Please find our updates below:

**Technical Operations:**

Our Testnet Node CPU time is on the threshold just below 0.5ms (Still compliant on the median), mainly due to OC being disbaled as per B1's advice.

We have been approached by [wax.io](http://wax.io/) to build an iteration of an existing marketplace making use of new NFT standards providing for new assets. We are still having conversations with Malcolm to finalise the [wax.io](http://wax.io/) business requirements and success criteria.

At this stage it is expected that we will develop the smart contracts, frontend, provide maintenance and possibly the graphical user experience. I will have solid feedback this coming week, however it is worth the mention in this update showing that we are a trusted builder in our industry #BUIDL

Still awesome, however only currently producing on the WAX Testnet in position #1 though :)

Upgraded our WAX Hyperion Infrastructure to v3.1.0 BETA.4 - [https://twitter.com/eosphere_io/status/1283971687529078784?s=20](https://twitter.com/eosphere_io/status/1283971687529078784?s=20)

This month we ran a **build on WAX and leverage NFT's drive** using our free 30min consultation to help kick start interest from existing businesses and potential new starters. We only had 5 x 30min consults picked up on .. and to be honest they were not suitable for WAX. Interestingly 2 of the five were government focused.

Of course we are still steering the course and will report on any successful engagements :)

We officially signed our partnership with dfuse this month, meaning that our clients can procure the full suite of defuse products and services through us.. we see this as an excellent enabler and have already leveraged our partnership with a current client. -

We are also bringing the LiquidApps DAPP Network to WAX and we are part of the oversight WAX DSP group controlling the msig for the contract.. along with MaltaBlock and EOSUSA. We are ready to go with this.. however I am not sure of the interest in the product, do you guys see the potential of the DAPP network on WAX?

Our current twitter following is 5,300 and we are just as engaged with our community now as we were in January 2018. ([https://twitter.com/eosphere_io](https://twitter.com/eosphere_io))

As mentioned to Rob, I still believe geographical distribution is a key point for a healthy network and WAX business. I don't mean only where you run your servers, but what jurisdiction you operate under.

# Pre-Evaluation Form Responses

### Please provide some information regarding when and how your Guild got involved with the EOSIO or WAX ecosystem. Links to resources are helpful.

We started EOSphere at the beginning of 2018 as BP candidates for EOS ([https://busy.org/@eosphere/presenting-eosphere-as-a-founding-eos-block-producer-candidate](https://busy.org/@eosphere/presenting-eosphere-as-a-founding-eos-block-producer-candidate)). We support many EOSIO chains and loved the digital goods solution and promotion WAX was doing and decided to register as a guild. You can read our Q2 update here ([https://busy.org/@eosphere/why-eosphere-q2-2019](https://busy.org/@eosphere/why-eosphere-q2-2019))

### Has anyone in the Guild previously produced blocks on an EOSIO or DPOS network in the past? If so, which ones and what nodes did they help operate?

Yes, us as EOSphere participate on many EOSIO networks. EOS, Worbli, Telos, MEET.ONE, Jungle, ORE, BOS, FORCE and now WAX. Public API's , BP Nodes, Full History Nodes, Hyperion etc.

### If your Guild has a warrant canary, please provide the link to it.

### Please state the jurisdiction your Guild is domiciled in, as well as the jurisdiction that your Guild's nodes are deployed in.

### Please share any usage metrics you have, if any. This includes data specific to applications and user activity driven to the WAX ecosystem as a result of your Guild's efforts.

### If possible, please share information about businesses that your Guild is engaging with that are seeking to learn about and leverage the WAX ecosystem in some way.

We have a project management, development and consulting business EOSphere {/dev} ([https://www.eosphere.io/dev/](https://www.eosphere.io/dev/)) We are eager to build on WAX through the WPS. It is entirely possible that one of our clients will deploy on WAX and we are certainly promoting the option.

### Please share any information regarding community building efforts championed by your Guild. This can be facilitating translation of documentation, organizing meetups, and otherwise driving social and human engagement within the platform.

As mentioned in a previous question we are very active on Social Media and have been promoting WAX with purpose. ([https://twitter.com/eosphere_io](https://twitter.com/eosphere_io)) we also ran a WAX Australian Tour across Sydney, Perth and Melbourne with Malcolm CasSelle.
