### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
We successfully completed our Internet Service Provider maintenance on the 25th of February. There was a 30 minute disruption to our WAX Hyperion Full History, block production and other APIâ€™s weren't effected.

HeadsUp v0.1.9 was released.

Be sure to check out the public showcase of HeadsUp to get a feel for the platforms capability here -> https://headsup.eosphere.io/

We recently noticed some variation in our Block Production Benchmarks. These variations went unnoticed after an upgrade from v4.0.4 to v5.0.3 however this has been remedied by adjusting system and WAX software configuration. We will produce a WAX Technical How To on CPU optimisations in the near future.

**Update**: 
If you are technically curious or interested in running services on the WAX network, be sure to have a look at our WAX Technical How To series published monthly in the EOSphere Blog on Medium.

These guides are being added to the WAX Developer GitHub.

This month we updated our guides for v1.3.24 and 2025 on how to build, configure, deploy and optimise a WAX Atomic Node. We actually built a new server ans successfully recovered from a postgres dump.
