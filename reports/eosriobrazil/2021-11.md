## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?


We have started assembling new BPs using the new Intel’s Alder Lake processor, and hope it can significantly improve CPU performance. Once we have the server ready we will start testing and collaborating with other teams to tune BP performance and contribute to operational practices. 

We have decided to focus on implementing the new transaction lifecycle features of Hyperion 3.3.5 and relieve the heaviest load on API infrastructures as dApps makes multiple get_transaction to check tx irreversibility. EOS Rio endpoints are currently serving 30.8 Million requests per day. We have implemented smart cache for get_transactions to increase performance and availability but this version needs full reindexing and the team decided to focus on stabilizing it and allowing other teams to operate it, before going for a full reindex. The plan is to have a second Hyperion instance available for WAX, the machine is assembled and in final testing for deployment on one of our sites, this will allow .

Hyperion - v3.3.5 was released early november, the biggest news is the custom indexing plugin support, allowing for easy custom indexing by  operators. The team is currently working on a Atomic API plug in. https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api


QRY Client - We added a Sr Engineer to work specifically on a Client/SDK to abstract all the endpoint selection and transaction lifecyle management for developers, reducing the work and EOS specific knowledge demanded from developers working on WAX. We expect to have a working prototype in 12 to 18 weeks. 

Hyperion Hub - A real health check for Hyperion instances that publishes data to a hub allowing users to select the best endpoints to connect. Currently in closed beta with whitelisted providers and soon to be opened to the wider community. https://hub.hyperion.eosrio.io/

SIMPLEOS Wallet - Operational but with no major improvements on the last 30 days other than support interactions on EOS Rio’s group. https://github.com/eosrio/simpleos

There are already contracts signed with soccer clubs, musicians and content creator agencies. Other verticals are also in the pipeline. Block4 was recently funded by Mercado Bitcoin, the biggest exchange in Latin America, and are starting to explore synergies with them including WAX listing.

WAX listing on Mercado Bitcoin - With 3M+ users MBTC is the largest exchange in Brazil and Latin America, earlier in 2021 it received a USD 200M+ investment from SoftBank, and is expanding to other digital assets. We have initiated talks to list WAX focusing on the NFT and Gaming demand, but are still to evolve to technical talks or a potential listing. After first contact the process is moving ahead considering that the exchange have a new listing model that can make it easier to integrate. We are talking to Fabrício Tota, Mercado Bitcoin's Director (https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabriciotota)
