## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?


We have finished assembly of the new BPs using the new Intel’s Alder Lake processor, and have started tunning the server to benchmark performance. We will start testing and collaborating with other teams to tune BP performance and contribute to operational practices. 

We are currently working on implementing a full history cluster in Europe to serve the surging demand. In December EOS Rio served more than 50 Tb in requests across all APIs. 

We have decided to focus on implementing the new transaction lifecycle features of Hyperion 3.3.5 and relieve the heaviest load on API infrastructures as dApps makes multiple get_transaction to check tx irreversibility. EOS Rio endpoints are currently serving 30.8 Million requests per day. We have implemented smart cache for get_transactions to increase performance and availability but this version needs full reindexing and the team decided to focus on stabilizing it and allowing other teams to operate it, before going for a full reindex. While setting up the new Europe Cluster we are working on troubleshooting, including a still unidentified bug the our current Hyperion cluster to index from the genesis block.

Hyperion - v3.3.5 was released early november, the biggest news is the custom indexing plugin support, allowing for easy custom indexing by  operators. The team is currently working on a Atomic API plug in and on supporting developers using. https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api


QRY Client - We added a Sr Engineer to work specifically on a Client/SDK to abstract all the endpoint selection and transaction lifecyle management for developers, reducing the work and EOS specific knowledge demanded from developers working on WAX. We expect to have a working prototype in 12 to 14 weeks. 

Hyperion Hub - A real health check for Hyperion instances that publishes data to a hub allowing users to select the best endpoints to connect. Currently in closed beta with whitelisted providers and soon to be opened to the wider community. https://hub.hyperion.eosrio.io/

SIMPLEOS Wallet - Operational but with no major improvements on the last 30 days other than support interactions on EOS Rio’s group. https://github.com/eosrio/simpleos

Block4 - A digital collectible platform based on WAX developed by the EOS Rio team, that allows sports organizations, artists, influencers and content creators in general to create customizable digital collectible platforms to engage and monetize their communities. We are launching platforms with Vasco, soccer team from Rio with a fanbase of 10 million people, to sell digital collectible cards for each of their matches, and Pitty, a rock’n’roll and TV Presenter. Block4 was recently funded by Mercado Bitcoin, the biggest exchange in Latin America, and are starting to explore synergies with them including WAX listing.

WAX listing on Mercado Bitcoin - With 3M+ users MBTC is the largest exchange in Brazil and Latin America, earlier in 2021 it received a USD 200M+ investment from SoftBank, and is expanding to other digital assets. After an initial meeting they are open to integrating but for Q2, or Q3. We will keep following up.

Neverest - We are negotiating with Neverest, a gaming community of 11 thousand players and 20 thousand spectators to launch NFTs and play-to-earn games on WAX leveraging major esports teams in Brazil. Neverest have already developed the frontend and are currently working on connecting to the application.
