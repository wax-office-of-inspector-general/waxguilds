## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

The BPs using the new Alder Lake Intel processors that were deployed in May continue to show a significant improvement in performance relative to BPs with older tech. 

Our infrastructure in Brazil and Europe continues to operate without issues. More than 20 million native API calls are being served by our clusters, as well as 2 million full history calls daily.



## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Hyperion - Our focus continues to be to stabilize the current version, committing our developers to solving bug fixes as well as updating components. Clarion and OCI protocols changes are being combed through, so we are prepared to adapt as needed as soon as the updates go live.

QRY Client -  The Client/SDK development partnership with a local university continues to be developed. Our goal is to create endpoint selection but lifecycle management have been deprecated since it will be incorporated on nodeos by OCI, while also building a new dev community.

SIMPLEOS Wallet - Operational but with no major improvements on the last 30 days other than support interactions on EOS Rioâ€™s group. https://github.com/eosrio/simpleos


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Block4 - Developed by the EOS Rio team, this digital collectible platform based on WAX allows sports organizations, artists, influencers, content creators and more create customizable digital collectible platforms. This opens the door for community engagement and monetization. In 2022 we have already partnered with three of the biggest soccer clubs in Brazil (Vasco, Santos and Bahia), with more than 15 million supporters. Through this marketplace we have over 1000 collectors, 3800+ NFTs sold and a solid secondary market in place.

WAX listing on Mercado Bitcoin - With 3M+ users MBTC is the largest exchange in Brazil and Latin America. In 2021 it received a USD 200M+ investment from SoftBank, and is expanding to other digital assets. After an initial meeting they are open to integrating but for Q3 we are already in technical talks to integrate WAXE since it would be easier for them. We will keep following up.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

Recently we have begun efforts in educational and informative content. Through our YouTube channel, we will release a new series of introductory videos, called Rio Blocks Academy. Through it, our plan is to create an easy to understand path for new blockchain users to learn and join our Brazilian and LATAM community.

Also currently in the works is our news website, where we aim to cover news from the WAX blockchain. Additionally, every Friday a new video will be released with a round up of the biggest stories on the blockchain, to keep our community informed in a fast, fun and easy to consume way.

Naturally, we aim to focus our efforts on the blockchains we currently support, WAX being one of them. We will have more updates on these community building efforts in future updates.
