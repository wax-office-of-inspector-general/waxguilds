## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We had a severe infrastructure issue mid-august that impacted all services except Block Production. The team is already working on improving reliability and monitoring of those services, and all services are back online at the moment of writing. Currently working on deploying a second Hyperion cluster with the full history, used also for research purposes.

The team is also working on a more robust API infrastructure considering a load balancer distributing requests for a Nodeos cluster to serve significant higher volumes.

Our APIs are currently serving 20M+ requests/day from Brazil and UK

WAX listing on Mercado Bitcoin - With 3M+ users MB is the largest exchange in Brazil and Latin America. In 2021 it received a USD 200M+ investment from SoftBank, and is expanding to other digital assets. MB is an investor at Block4 and we meet regularly with their leadership. After an initial meeting they are open to integrating but for Q3, we are already in technical talks to integrate WAXE since it would be easier for them. And are currently discussing the new WAX DeFi model as they aim to offer this for their customers. 


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

In August we unveiled a new project: Hash Digest. Our goal is to bring the latest news from WAX, translated in an easy to read format, so that everything is as easy to understand as possible.

We also started a newsletter along with the website as well, where users can subscribe and receive every Friday a summary of the weekâ€™s biggest news. A video version is also in the works to be released on twitter.

Naturally, we aim to focus our efforts on the blockchains we currently support, WAX being one of them. We will have more updates on these community building efforts in future updates.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

We agree with the criteria and think that OIG does a great job in the setting and evaluation. EOS Rio was voted out of the top 21 after the recent technical evaluation, due to an infrastructure issue during the evaluation window, as we understand. Being out of the top 21 severely impacted our ability to contribute with the problem solving around the problems happening on the network since we do not have direct access to a producing node and can only ask other BPs for log and try to suggest actions instead of testing them first hand. Whitout questioning the fairness of the evaluation we just suggest some thought is directed at that trade off in making those changes considering that we could contribute much more with in producing position, especially considering that we got back into the schedule as the most performant BP after Pink unregged.
