## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

We agree with the criteria and think that OIG does a great job in the setting and evaluation. EOS Rio was voted out of the top 21 after the recent technical evaluation, due to an infrastructure issue during the evaluation window, as we understand. Being out of the top 21 severely impacted our ability to contribute with the problem solving around the problems happening on the network since we do not have direct access to a producing node and can only ask other BPs for log and try to suggest actions instead of testing them first hand. Whitout questioning the fairness of the evaluation we just suggest some thought is directed at that trade off in making those changes considering that we could contribute much more with in producing position, especially considering that we got back into the schedule as the most performant BP after Pink unregged.
