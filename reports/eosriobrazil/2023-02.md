## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Antelope 3.1 upgrade readiness - All nodes are updated.

We had a severe infrastructure issue mid-august that impacted all services except Block Production. The team is already working on improving reliability and monitoring of those services, and all services are back online at the moment of writing. Currently working on deploying a second Hyperion cluster with the full history, used also for research purposes.

The team is also working on a more robust API infrastructure considering a load balancer distributing requests for a Nodeos cluster to serve significant higher volumes.

Our APIs are currently serving 20M+ requests/day from Brazil and UK

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We keep working on our community efforts to grow WAX in Brazil. We have two members with a mod role on WAX's official server on Discord who have the opportunity to launch the first PT-BR tab. Therefore, this tab is used to spread content about WAX in Portuguese, such as tutorials, news, updates, and more. 


A new initiative started last month on our social media - AMA series about the Blockchains we operate. The main goal of the Twitter Spaces session is to bring educational content with more fun, and opportunities to talk and have more contact with the community we are building. Our first session was about Ultra, and well received by the public, reuniting 21 listeners, and transforming itself into one of the most engaging posts on our Twitter account.

Our content website, Hashdigest, has been updated with a fresh view and new features. 



New dedicated buttons to Discord were added. We understand that Discord is a place to be with the community, and now it has your own space. 

An NFT calendar was also implemented. As collections are announced, we add all the information - important dates, website, background, etc - and share it with the public. It's a way of promoting the collection but also engaging the community.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

Keep up the great work!
