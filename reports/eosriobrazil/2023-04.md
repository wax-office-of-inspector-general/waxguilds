QRY - We are working on a solution to allow developers to abstract all the complexity of choosing and connecting to Chain and History API endpoints. QRY will automatically select and connect to the best endpoints available making sure the service is always available to developers, that won't need to worry with any infrastructure. We expect to launch QRY in May focusing on WAX and are already coordinating with other teams operating infrastructure for WAX. The project is still closed source at this point, but we have shared more details with the OIG.

Hyperion - v3.3.9 was launched on Jan 18th.
