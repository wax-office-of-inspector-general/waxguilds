Hyperion - In the past month, we released two new ways to help developers who want to start using Hyperion: Docker and LXD. 
Docker is a multi-container application that helps to get Hyperion running as fast as possible. It checks indexed blocks of those who operate Hyperion, and cleans up fake blocks and actions that have been forked out. 
In addition, we host an LXD image that contains a pre-configured Hyperion instance. 
All the information and steps are here: https://hyperion.docs.eosrio.io/providers/install/docker/ https://hyperion.docs.eosrio.io/providers/install/lxd/

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We keep up helping people on the Brazilian tab on Discord by answering questions about the WAX ecosystem, giving more information, and producing dedicated content. Recently, our social media team has joined a small NFT community that has a lot of doubts about Digital Pops! to help with tutorials, solving any doubts, and presenting the chain so that the Brazilian public can buy the NFTs without major problems. 

For the next few days, we're adding new content to our editorial calendar like ecosystem reviews for NFTs and games, and more of our internal content for the developers' audience.
