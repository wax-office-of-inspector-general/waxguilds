**Original Content:**

- **Potential of WAX DEFI** — https://waxgalaxy.io/blog/wax-could-offer-the-best-nft-defi-option-this-decade [We will also get this promoted and shared this coming month with a giveaway NFT for WAX defi]

- **WAX Defi Summary** — WAX DEFI has been returning high rewards averaging around ~70% APR! yet awareness is still very low. In order to help raise awareness, we created a page on our new website that lists out the rewards distributed to date. People can now easily see the consistent rewards WAX has distributed over time when making the decision to enter WAX DEFI. We will continue to promote WAX DEFI using stats from this page and add charts to help the visualisation. — https://waxgalaxy.io/wax-blockchain-defi
