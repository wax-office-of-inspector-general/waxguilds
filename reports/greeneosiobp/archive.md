### April 2020

Dear IG team,

I forgot to add information about our progress on Institutional interest about Swedish Blockchain Association in the evaluation form.

As I wrote in the previous month, I have proposed listing WAX on the SBA website and promoting it in through Swedish Blockchain Association channels to the team and they accepted it. They are also interested in creating a WPS to do some events. The website update will be done soon and also they will start promoting content as well. We are drafting an announcement soon.

Thanks!
