## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### New product release: https://names.waxdao.io

This is a name service combined with a blender. Owners of premium WAX accounts can sell subdomains on here, and require buyers to pay with any combination of 1 or more NFTs and/or fungible tokens.

They can also whitelist people based on who is holding certain NFTs in their wallet. Split payments are supported, creators can choose whether to burn or transfer any NFTs that they receive as payment for custom names.

### Progress On DAOs

We released a brand new DAO contract and UI. Multiple DAO configurations are supported, most importantly the option to set up a non-custodial DAO where voting power is based on voters holding specific NFTs in their wallets.

These DAOs have treasuries that support any WAX token, and also support NFTs. The only way to retrieve treasury assets from a DAO is to make a proposal, and vote.

If the proposal passes, the assets will be transferred automatically from the DAO treasury to the receiver(s) who were specified in the proposal.

### Progress on NFT Farms

Completed about half of a new v2 staking contract that will enable much higher amounts of NFTs to be staked in 1 non-custodial farm. New contract also has more mechanisms in place to protect users from malicious project owners.

Farms were also linked together with the new DAO contract, so that voting power can come from a custodial farm if the DAO creator chooses that configuration.

Voting power configuration also applies to token staking pools.

### Progress on Creator Tools

Began work on new versions of our pack, drop and blend contracts. Much of the logic for whitelisting, etc was taken into consideration when building the name service - so I'm refining and building upon that logic to improve the existing creator tools.

### Progress On Token Tools

Updated the market cap tracker to direct users to mycloudwallet and waxblock, instead of wax cloud wallet and bloks.
