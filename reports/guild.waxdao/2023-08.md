## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### Maybe new product, maybe combine with creator tools? You decide...

- created [royalty sharing contract](https://github.com/mdcryptonfts/royalty_contract/tree/main#readme), made a [UI for deploying it](https://waxdao.io/royalty-contract) to your account

- wrote a [tutorial]() to go with the royalty contract, explaining how to upload, eosio.code permission, how to use the different contract actions, etc

### Progress on Name Service

- Added a [control panel](https://names.waxdao.io/wallet) where sellers can view/manage their listings

- Added a [FAQ section](https://names.waxdao.io/faq) with pics and instructions

- Many misc maintenance/UI improvements (Kaefer advised not to make you guys read through the entire sprint list)

### Progress On DAOs

- Misc UI improvements

### Progress on NFT Farms

- Created [custom non-custodial farm](https://waxdao.io/farm/succubank) to ingtegrate Lembas 666 PFP project

- Created new version of farms (non-custodial), where the farms can hold unlimited NFTs instead of being capped at a few thousand. The farm config also can not be modified while NFTs are staked in it, which prevents stakers from being rugged by changing reward amounts or removing assets from the farm (to the extent that we can actually control... we obv can not prevent token balances from being erased by contract owners etc)

- Made [video](https://youtu.be/PIV_ojHzkS8) explaining how the new farms work

- Added action to [batch kick users](https://waxblock.io/account/farms.waxdao?action=kickmany#contract-actions) from a farm

### Progress on Creator Tools

- Added [empty contract](https://waxdao.io/remove-contract) utility so people can remove contracts from their account

- added [metrics](https://waxblock.io/account/waxdaomarket?code=waxdaomarket&scope=waxdaomarket&table=metrics&lower_bound=&upper_bound=&limit=10#contract-tables) to waxdaomarket, to track: total_drop_claims and total_blend_claims, and total_pack_openings

- About 90% done with a new contract that we will allow users to deploy to their accounts... this contract will be a "pseudo-backed-tokens" contract, allowing collection owners to automatically send fungible tokens to whoever burns one of their NFTs. Goes without saying that this is not as "guaranteed" as backing WAX into an NFT through AA, because we can't guarantee that the contract owner will not just erase their contract etc

- Did an overhaul of the [user profile page](https://waxdao.io/u/mikedcrypto5) on WaxDAO. Added custom profiles, links to any DAOs, token staking pools, drops, and unbox links created by a user. Also added better API error handling when fetching data from multiple different contracts to create this UI. Added a new "default" profile image as well (courtesy of NeonSpace), so the page doesn't look like cancer if a user hasn't set up their profile yet.
 
- Added another ad slot to promote wax projects

- Updated NFT cards so images show properly when the NFT data contains a full link instead of an IPFS hash, and also to prioritize videos, also added more possible image trait names (cover, back , etc)

### Progress On Token Tools

- handled token listing requests (and submitted [pull request to Alcor](https://github.com/avral/alcor-ui/pull/716/commits/f72d6dc7d594696aec454f495b697306365972a4)) for:
