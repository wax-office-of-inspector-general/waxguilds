## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

- Added USDCUSD and USDTUSD pairs to delphioracle script
- Within ~10 hours of first reports of network-wide AA incident, I applied a temporary fix by altering the postgres table structure to varchar(13). This allowed me to get synced, and back up and running. Once the 1.3.24 pull request was shared by fabian, I also checked out the PR and [upgraded to 1.3.24](https://aa.waxdaobp.io/health)

- aa.waxdaobp.io - 6.06M requests per day (~12.6k unique/day)

- Created a [testnet UI](https://testnames.waxdao.io) for name service so users can get a feel before using mainnet

- Misc bug fixes, UI improvements and contract updates

- Added logic for premium name owners to create subdomain blacklists (i.e. if you listed the name "oig" on the name service, you could prevent someone from buying "official.oig" or "kaefer.oig"(even if these accounts don't actually exist yet), but still allow them to buy all other ".oig" names) 

- Created a new open source contract that creators can deploy to their account. The contract allows them to reward people with fungible tokens and/or NFTs whenever an NFT from the collection(s)/schema(s)/template(s) they specify are burned. Essentially it's "backed NFTs" that can be backed with any token, or even other NFTs - however the creator has control over the contract, and the tokens/nfts they reward.. so obviously this doesn't provide the same level of guarantee to the end user, since the creator has control of the contract.

The backed NFTs contract is currently [on Github](https://github.com/mdcryptonfts/backed-nfts/tree/main), about 95% finished and just needing a bit of final touches, documentation and testing before I go ahead and create a UI for deploying it.
