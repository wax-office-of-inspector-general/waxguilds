## What is the name of your Guild?

WAXUSA

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Still working on expanding out the infrastructure to utilize all the new equipment recently brought in to accommodate the chain loads.  Primary and redundant BP nodes are in place, recently completed recreating the redundant state history nodes required for all internal services, and beginning to rebuild the servers needed to reopen all chain services back to the general public.  Next on the list is to rebuild a new Hyperion history cluster with the latest version as well as a local Atomic API (both we hope to open for public access again soon as well).

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

We have spent a large amount of effort getting the wax.stats.eosusa.news site back fully operational and updated with new features.  Found that some of the recent changes APIs put in place would actually hang/crash the polling nodes, so that has been addressed and the probes are again more stable.  Also identified and resolved some of the issues with the system pulling in new endpoints for testing (related to new Atomic APIs being listed) and new guilds endpoints are starting to show up in the automatic polls/tests.  Lastly, added logic to begin polling and reporting on Atomic API nodes/status as well to the site.

Still seeing 1000s of daily users across all the sites we've developed:
- wax.stats.eosusa.news:    750 DAU   | 18000 MAU
- awstats.io:               1000 DAU  | 41000 MAU

Continued development of our airdropping tools (referred to as "Butler" now) and services and now offer dropping services/logic outside of the Alien Worlds mining data.  We now offer automated drop services distributing NFTs out to collection holders based on NFT/set ownership.  Similar to the BountyBlok distribution mechanism, but more automated and a bit more customizable (collection scoring and respective rewards, etc.).

Also have focused development efforts into creating a process to better collect/detect automatic botting of our Butler drop services.  Currently collect around 40,000 accounts to exclude from all our services and working to create a system to better collect information from around the ecosystem and via chain data.  Also had to rewrite several pieces of logic to properly handle the chain data being read (handling 14mil daily mining actions and 40K blacklist accounts takes some effort xD)

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Working with several projects to help them develop or futher utilize and integrate into the WAX blockchain.  TheUplift.World has recently started publishing in-game actions to the blockchain, so we have begun writing automated services to further expand on that game functionality (airdrops, reports, etc.).  Also working with other gaming projects to create new/additional games around thier WAX NFT collections/projects (Alien Worlds, ArtVndngMchn, several others in discussions). 

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

As always, providing technical support/assistance for many of the guilds and also participating in different streams/shows to discuss and promote the WAX ecosystem.  Recently hired a new marketing/promotions staff member to begin creating and promoting more content about the WAX ecosystem and the projects we are working with.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

Not sure the GitHub update method is the best method, but understand you guys are trying new things out to make the overall process and experience better :)
