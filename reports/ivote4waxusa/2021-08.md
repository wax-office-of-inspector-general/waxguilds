## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Had a fun month of fighting the elements and power issues.  New UPS eqiupment has been installed and construction on new server room with 60KVa generator is nearing completion.  New hardware has been installed to increase additional public services load and work has begun on the new Hyperion history server.  Also began opening up private access to our current Hyperion cluster for projects needing dedicated history node access.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Cleaned up the navigation and layout of some of the wax.stats.eosusa.news sections to make the information more readable. 

Seeing a slight reduction in users hitting our AW sites (aw.eosusa.io & awstats.io), but still seeing 1000 DAU and 24K MAU.

Continue to develop and add features to the Butler NFT dropping system we built and running AW mining airdrop promotions for the following projects:
* Alien Worlds (we handle their pack drops and upcoming event for new cards being released for mining rewards)
* Kenn Bosak
* Byron Rempel
* UltraRare
* Coneland
* Luminaya/Galaktika
* C.A.I.T.
* Mercenary Arts (Little Monsters)
* GrafittiKings
* KinderMiners

I recently developed a new system (called EOSUSA Scores for now) that automatically calculates a collector's "score" based off the NFTs they hold in their wallets. It is based on the scoring values the collection owner specifies and automatically calculated with up-to-date scoring values.  We then have used this scoring information to feed into many different airdrop/distribution campaigns such as distributing tokens and airdropping cards (or entire sets) to collectors with the qualifying scores.

Also working with Alien Worlds, the different communities airdropping cards, and developers around the ecosystem to develop a system to help detect and twart the abuse from the bots and automated scripts.  Hosting servers and providing sevices to analyze the data/traffic patterns as well as creating methods for the communities/members to feed potential bad actors back to the system for further verification and blacklisting if needed.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Work with many of the different projects around the ecosystem to help them develop thier projects and integrate into the WAX blockchain:

Work very closely with the Alien Worlds team to provide many different services such as statistics, dropping services, 24/7 staffed player support help desk, and working on developing an additional/integrated mini-game for their platform (as mentioned on call).

Continue to work with TheUplift.World team and as more of their platform is integrated into the chain will be able to offer many automation and airdropping services for their communities.  Also closely working with their team on an upcoming NFT related platform they are developing.

Working with the BullShipples community to help them migrate their community from the EOS chain over to the WAX.  Deployed initial token contract and will be working with them to expand their project to WAX

Also in discussions with some projects on other chains that are interested in integrating WAX into their platforms and will provide more information abou that as I am able.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

As always, providing technical support/assistance for many of the guilds and also participating in different streams/shows to discuss and promote the WAX ecosystem. New marketing staff member focusing on completing the rebranding of our sites to allow for additional promotion of events and benefits of utilizing the WAX blockchain.
