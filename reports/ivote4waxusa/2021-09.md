## What is the name of your Guild?

WAXUSA

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

This month we focused on completing the upgrades of our on-premesis infrastructure environment.  We have completed the build-out of new, dedicated server room with redundant cooling solutions.  Also installed new 60kW generator as well added additional UPS battery backups for the recently added servers.  Also implementing latest batch of new i9 servers to be utilized as primary and backup Hyperion services to replace existing servers with limited capacity.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

This month we completed the initial redesign of our primary website (eosusa.io) as well as upgrading the aw.eosusa.io AW site.  Along with the launch, we worked with Alien Worlds to help promote the services as well as all the projects that are cross-promoting with the game.  All projects running active drops (some up to 50/hr) can be found here:  aw.eosusa.io/events

Our new Collection Scoring product has completed it's initial development and is in use by projects for regular token drops for their project.  Upgraded logic to automatically retrieve all project collections/templates and then calculate a score for each based off the number of cards issued.  That information is then being fed into airdrop scripts and soon will be used to create and offer scoring dashboarding for projects to subscribe to.  Working on official page for service/logs but initial scoring/airdrop log example here:  https://aw.eosusa.io/awbutler/mercartscore.html

Also helped many projects out with custom airdrop processes such as the Galaktika raffle after their pack opening issues (packs ran out of cards, we ran airdrop of remaining cards out to previous pack owners).  We're filling gaps as the projects need help :)

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Still working with all the projects around the ecosystem to provide support for them where they need, either with drop services, contract deployments, or even development of games/platforms to enhance the usability of their collections.  In discussions with several projects for larger projects such as Alien Worlds, GraffitiKings, Mercenary Arts, and ArtVndngMchn.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

Rebranded our sites to allow us to help our projects we work with gain more exposure as well as inform other projects of the services we can offer.  Always providing technical support for members of the community in the channels and making my rounds on the different social platforms doing podcasts/interviews.  Now that web branding has been completed, hoping to begin a more active social campaign to increase awareness of all the projects around the ecosystem.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

For the record, I don't agree that a server crashing in the middle of the night and being repaired as soon as they were awake and aware should be grounds for an automatic demotion.  I agree it's not ideal and should even carry a penalty to discourage, but when the primary focus of the chain has been to invest into developing products and advancement of the chain, to then pull the majority operating budget for the team for a month over a server crashing (that we all agree doesnt really have great failovers or effective monitoring) seems a bit harsh. :)
