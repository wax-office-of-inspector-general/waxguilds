## What is the name of your Guild?

WAXUSA

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We have finally completed the infrastructure buildout of the new server room and have migrated most servers over to the new environment with redundant power and cooling solutions.  Also completed installation of latest batch of i9 hardware purchases and have begun deploying into redundant setups of WAX StateHist and Hyperion to have the redundancy to provide our drop/reporting services with minimal outages.  Hope to soon reopen our history services back up for public use as well as complete the build-outs of the on-premise redundant Atomic APIs.  Also still running one-off services for projects such as pack opening processing for Facings, etc.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Still running dozens of drops for Alien World and projects promoting on the platform and more information on them can be found here:  aw.eosusa.io/events

We have continued developing our Collection Scoring product and are using it for some projects to feed additional airdrops or promotions.  Example of scoring here: https://aw.eosusa.io/awbutler/mercartscore.html

Recently, we created a new Alcor LP Reward service that calculates all user's percentage of the LP and will automatically reward the LP holders respective to their holding percentage.  Example of service here: https://aw.eosusa.io/awbutler/mercarts-liqpool.html  In relation to that, we've begun assisting projects with creating/deploying/configuring their own project token contract and distributing tokens via different airdrop methods.

Additionally, upon request of some projects, we have developed a collection AtomicMarket reporting system that allows collection owners to generate reports on their collection sales and market fees collected so they can properly distrubute their agreed upon revenue sharing with their artist.  Service indexes and tracks all sales and provides simple interface to extract summary data.  System currently private but can demo/provide screenshots as needed.
Also developed custom reporting scripts that provide overall collection information such as template IDs and rarities to assist projects with gather data needed related to their collections.  Lastly, developed an automated service to help projects who have sales from packs trickling in automatically stake those funds and claim rewards accordingly.  More information about all new services available as needed (working on updating sites to provide better details of services)

Of course still continue to keep the wax.stats.eosusa.news site operational and hope to be adding some additional chain data/stats to the site soon.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Still working with all the projects around the ecosystem to provide support for them where they need, either with drop services, contract deployments, or even development of games/platforms to enhance the usability of their collections.  In discussions with several projects for larger projects such as Alien Worlds, GraffitiKings, Mercenary Arts, and ArtVndngMchn.
