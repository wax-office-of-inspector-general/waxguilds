## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Latest batch of i9s deployed as WAX SHiP and API nodes and working on current batch of i9s to build additional full Hyperion instance as well as get our in-house Atomic APIs back up and running.  Had a pretty brutal month fighting attacks/abuse on the public API infrastruture and ended up having to agressively throttle repeat connetions along with banning clients that are repeatedly getting contract failures (ie: smashing till it's accepted).  Working on implementing better logging system of all proxy traffic to get a better gauge on what exactly is being used/abused to better prevent abuse.  Because of the recent attacks and how it impacted our entire operations, I rehomed our primary BP node out to a NY data center.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Run many of the Alien World automated drops for both AW and other communities around the WAX ecosystem (aw.eosusa.io/events).  Also still running other custom automated services for projects, such as Collection Scoring (aw.eosusa.io/awbutler/mercartscore.html) and Alcor LP Rewards (aw.eosusa.io/awbutler/mercarts-liqpool.html).  Also starting conversations with Trains of Century game on WAX to work with them to provide the infrastruture they need as well as some of our additional statistics and automation services as well.

Also have several projects we are working with developing new features for their project or game, but will send details on those projects via email as they are not public yet.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Always working to help the projects we work with to understand and implement different features with the WAX chain and other supporting services like Atomic and Hyperion.

This month also worked with VibraVid.io to begin looking at integrating the WAX blockchain into their platform.  Deployed their BTZC token contract and helped consult them on how to interact with the chain/etc.  https://vibravid.medium.com/how-to-swap-tron-btzc-to-wax-blockchain-7781e35131e

Always providing technical support for members of the community in the channels and making my rounds on the different social platforms doing podcasts/interviews.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
