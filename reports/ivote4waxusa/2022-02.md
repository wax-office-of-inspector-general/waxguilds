## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

February was spent getting much of the new hardware in place for redundancy to mission-critical services like APIs, SHiP, etc.  Deployed fully synced AtomicAssets API infrastructure with dedicated indexing and read-only API servers to handle loads.  Re-opened limited public access to both our Hyperion history and Atomic APIs.  Additionally, we are now providing full Hyperion history services on latest builds for the WAX Testnet as well.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

**WAX Stats** - Still providing real-time testing of all API nodes detected around the ecosystem and in February handled 5,100 unique visitors with 20k pageviews.

**AW Stats** - Still working on getting the historical data linked back in to be usable within web queries.  Have been identifying some gaps in data on the chain which we have nailed down to repetative empty blocks by all producers (which is currently being investigated further).

**Collection Scoring** - Had to chase issue with sort order of /atomicassets/v1/templates query to assure all template IDs properly detected for scoring.  Also adjusted scoring logic to use external score override values to ease ability for collection owners to control scoring logic.

**AWButler, Alcor PoolTools, & Account Butler** services still running multiple jobs daily for projects.

**Player Support** - Still providing Tier 1&2 player support (help desk) for projects.  Recently expanded full-time personnel from 4 to 6.

**WAX/Minecraft Services** - Initial MVP1 has been deployed to on-premise production servers (https://minecraft.eosusa.io) and initial load testing of services has begun:  https://mcsrvstat.us/server/minecraft.eosusa.io:25565

**MonsterStrike** - Completed initial development of Improvement feature (using one NFT to upgrade another's stats).  Now beginning development of next feature: Hatching.

**Hosted Services** - Really had an uptick in interest in providing hosted nodes for different projects around the ecosystem (some previous contacts, some new via referrals).  Working to get https://eosusa.io/hosting finished up but has initial info available now.  Recently started providing public WAX API, Hyperion, and AtomicAssets services for the following projects:
- MetaSource Games
- InfoCore 
- The Uplift World

**Blockchain Consulting Sevices** - Still consulting with pile of projects around the ecosystem but last month or so been heavily involved with the projects implementing private nodes or that we are providing other services for.
