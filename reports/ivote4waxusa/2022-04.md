## Technical Update

This month has been a brutal one from the technical front.  Spent many, many hours getting new private Atomic servers up for clients (now have 5 independent Atomic/SHiP setups in-house), then spent a crazy amount of time tweaking and fighting performance issues.  Also had a hard drive failure in primary Hyperion server, so rolled over to backups and now have a 3rd instance available servicing requests.  Has also been a tough month from the public API side where we've been targeted with several excessive waves (11K+ reqs/sec) of automated traffic that cripples the network and nodes and requires us to severely rate limit them to maintain network stability.

## Product Development Updates

**Wax Stats** - I believe there was an update to someone's bp.json related to Hyperion that broke the node list feed out to the probes to automatically find/test Hyperion services.  Now that Atomic is a bit less consuming, will chase down what's broken the polling for those in WaxStats.

**AWButler** - Continue to run automated services for land owners to cross-promote community projects

**TacoButler** - As requested by some players, we adapted our AWButler processes to provide the same style of automated services for Venue owners in the new Taco app.

**Collection Scoring** - Had the original script-based process converted into a service-based process with MySQL backend to expand features and use cases.  Will begin offering real-time scoring dashboards for processes and data-only endpoints so the information can be queries and used and integrated into other processes.

**Alcor PoolTools, & Account Butler** - Still running the services for a few projects and have recently started updating the https://eosusa.games site to provide information about many of the different services we have developed and offer.

**Player Support** - Still providing Tier 1&2 player support (help desk) for projects.  Beginning discussions with other projects about potential use of the services.

**WAX/Minecraft Services** - Intial testing of MVP1 has begun with internal staff and test events have been created, registered for, completed, and then rewarded on WAX mainnet.  Issues being identified and addressed to continue testing of MC/WAX integration.  Also beginning to integrate the additional Minecraft services/design to begin offering more tailored MC environments.  AlienWorlds has started releasing information about the services publically (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220328005182/en/Minecraft-Gamers-Can-Now-Earn-Trilium-From-the-Alien-Worlds-Metaverse) and we are working on the overall plans/timelines of incremental release to the public.

**MonsterStrike** - Completed another phase of deployment for the application (Hatching) which now allows us to create testnet NFTs for testers and they can begin testing the hatching and then improvement processes.  Beginning development on final feature (Evolve) and addressing any issues with current features during testing.

**In-House GameDev 1 (Space)** - In-house game development.  Initial MVP1 released for initial testing.  Can provide more details offline.

**In-House GameDev 2 (Horse)** - In-house game development.  Assembling dev team to begin POC creation.  Can provide more details offline.

## Ecosystem Development Updates

**Hosted Services** - Going to add a few new services to https://eosusa.io/hosting soon.  Still providing hosted APIs for MetaSource, InfoCore, Uplift, and talking to a few others looking to setup private nodes.

**Blockchain Consulting Sevices** - Still work with a few dozen different clients for random questions and consulting about blockchain services.  Began offering a monthly consulting package for projects that includes some dedicated consulting time each mornth as well as running automated services and data collection processes.  Began working with a few new projects like Isaiah @ CPU4.Less leasing service (he's relaunching a new version soon).

**EOSIO IBC*** - Deployed and maintaining an IBC relay node recently released by the Boid crew (and funded by Polmelo) to enable cross-chain transfers of all tokens between EOS, WAX, and Telos.  https://pomelo.io/grants/eosioibc
