## Technical Update
Finally made some great progress from the technical/infrastructure side of things!  I was able to get some additional firewalls up and running and more effectively split up all public API traffic and better mitigate the attacks/excessive connections on the nodes.  Additionally, I finally was able to track down the performance issues plaguing my Atomic nodes (related to NVME PCI architecture) and those are back to operating much more normal (but still putting hardware on tilt :))

Still offering (very) limited Hyperion and Atomic requests on our mainnet APIs as well as full Hyperion on testnet.  Working to deploy next round of hardware as Hyperion/Atomic to continue opening up the public APIs a bit more.

## Product Development Updates
**WAXStats** - Haven't made much progress on the dev/code side, but the servers that were hosting the statistics services started experiencing failures, so spent time to confirm system backup processes (and verify restores) and then migrated servers to new hardware/location.

**AWButler** - A few previous projects have restarted their Alien Worlds land drops as well as a few new projects investigating getting one started.

**TacoButler** - Still grinding out hourly NFT drops for owners of Taco Stands.

**Collection Scoring** - Completed update of data collection/processing to back-end servers and have begun focusing on creation of reports/services that will expose the information for clients (hosted reports as well as embedded into their website or fed via REST API calls).  Also added new feature (upon request) to recalc a "new" remaining mint number to account for all burned cards being removed (ie: #6 becomes #3 if the real #3, #4, & #5 are burned).

**Alcor PoolTools, & Account Butler** - Still running the services for a few projects and have recently started updating the https://eosusa.games site to provide information about many of the different services we have developed and offer.

**Player Support** - Still providing Tier 1&2 player support (help desk) for projects.

**WAX/Minecraft Services** - MVP1 testing still ongoing and daily events are being created, registered on-chain, completed (in Minecraft), then rewarded accordingly with TLM to their WAX wallets.  New features of environment and deployment being pushed through development environments and into production on 2 week cycles (confidential detailed information available if requested).

**MonsterStrike** - Paused development of final Evolving feature and focusing on testing primary features of Hatching & Improving.  Few bug fixes but mostly in user testing.

**In-House GameDev 1 (Space)** - In-house game development. Continued development on PvP feature (confidential detailed information available if requested).

**In-House GameDev 2 (Horse)** - In-house dev project. Presented initial POC to client for review.

**In-House GameDev 3 (Cars)** - In-house dev project. Created POC of platform and presented to the client for initial review.

## Ecosystem Development Updates
**Hosted Services** - Still providing hosted APIs for MetaSource, InfoCore, Uplift, and in discussions with others thinking about private nodes.  Increasing number of nodes in farm to better handle indexing/querying/failovers.

**Blockchain Consulting Sevices** - Still work with a few dozen different clients for random questions and consulting about blockchain services. Creation of datadumps for MetaSource events as well as creation/hosting of automated token distribution services.  Talking with projects/communities with ties to Alien Worlds about crossing over to WAX ecosystem for integration into AW gameplay.

**EOSIO IBC** - Deployed and maintaining an IBC relay node maintained by the Boid crew (and funded by Polmelo) to enable cross-chain transfers of all tokens between EOS, WAX, and Telos. https://pomelo.io/grants/eosioibc
