## Technical Update
With the new hardware in place, we've been able to relax some of the rate limits and restrictions on the public API nodes as well as open some of the additional API services more as well (Hyperion/Atomic).  Looks like with the current limits were seeing about 10mil API hits/day (stays maxed), 10K history/day, and a few K atomics/day.  Also finally got my bp.json moved over to our new domain and cleaned up for our nodes/services.

## Product Development
**WAX Stats** - Have to work on the process that parses the bp.jsons for endpoints as its hung up on some step.  Did recently add additional game statistics for Dark Galaxies project similar to the stats we provide for AlienWorlds.

**Butlers** - Still running AWButler and TacoButler services for few projects, and looking to develop new GalaxiesButler for the Dark Galaxies players/ecosystem.  Still running our Alcor PoolTools and AccountButler services, and recently added new daily token distribution butler for the CastlesNFT game https://aw.eosusa.io/awbutler/msource_bountydrop.html

**Collection Scoring** - Completed feature for tracking remaining mint number and now developing feature for tracking/excluding any NFTs listed on sale from the reward mechanisms (requested feature).

**Player Support** - Providing dedicated Tier 1/2 player support services for projects.

**WAX/Minecraft Integration** - Continued daily testing and opening to additional players for testing.  Deploying final features for enabling public access and beginning to work with AW to publicize the release.

**In-House Dev 1 (Space)** - Continued development of gameplay engine and NFT assets but still limited public information released.

** In-House Dev 3 (Cars)** - Completed initial UX design phase of application features and began building back-end database architecture for application then moving on to front.

## Ecosysystem Development
**Hosting Services** - Still providing dedicated hosted API infrastructure for Castles, DarkGalaxies, and TheUplift and in contact with others to hopefully add more.

**Blockchain Consulting Services** - Still consulting with many different projects around the ecosystem and recently added a GraffitiKings contract to help them with token distributions.  Also working with JustCarbon to look at bridging their token over to the WAX ecosystem (deployed on testnet).  Also adding another client who is having us write custom drop scripts and data extraction/reports.

**EOSIO IBC** - Still running the oracle nodes for the process but development has stalled until additional funding for the project is secured (or other IBC solutions are developed to replace it).
