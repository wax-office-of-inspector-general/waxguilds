## Technical Update
Been trying to get the migration away from the .news domain over to eosusa.io, and once I get the final validation errors (from EOSN) fixed, I will update final info for bp.json on-chain.  Completed upgrade of all WAX nodes to latest 3.1.0wax01 release as well.

Mainnet Endpoint Stats:
- RPC (7mil/day)
- Atomic (50K/day)
- Hyperion (1mil/day)

Testnet Endpoints:
- RPC
- Hyperion
- Atomic (NEW)

**Recent Issues** - Been constantly engaged in both public and private conversations with BPs troubleshooting different scenarios and comparing configurations.  Did determine that utilizing our DelphiOracle monitoring tools helps identify when the issues seem to start/stop and show some trx still make in the chain and seem agnostic to CPU resources.  Didn't find alot of info that helped, but tested alot of things that didn't matter trying to figure out WTF :)

## Product Development Updates
**WAXStats** - SysAdmin is starting to tear back through the code and get issues with automatically pulling json information in for all endpoints and properly error handling (so it doesn't break all the probes deploying the master list out).

**AWButler** - Recently added new feature targeting specific timed actions (vs random selection) and launched new event partnering with many other projects around the WAX ecosystem:  www.jrslands.com

**TacoButler** - Still grinding out hourly NFT drops for owners of Taco Stands.

**Collection Scoring** - Completed Remaining Mint feature and added Sell Tracking cooldowns (assets listed for sale dont count towards collection score for 7 days). Also added tiered bonus structures (#1,2,3,4-10,10-30 get higher scores) and now adding ability to calculate token distributions based on current contract token balance and testing distributions with new system.

**Alcor PoolTools, & Account Butler** - Still running the services for a few projects and have recently started updating the https://eosusa.games site to provide information about many of the different services we have developed and offer.

## Ecosystem Development Updates
**Hosted Services** - Still providing hosted APIs for MetaSource, InfoCore, Uplift, and in discussions with others thinking about private nodes.  Additional servers for upcoming contract installed and additional IP blocks being provisioned.

**Blockchain Consulting Sevices** - Still work with a few dozen different clients for random questions and consulting about blockchain services. Working with JustCarbon to integrate into WAX ecosystem (info FWD to WAX team) and token deployed on testnet.  Also consulting with GraffitiKings on development of their upcoming products
