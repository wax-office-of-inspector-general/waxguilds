## Technical Update
Finally completed migration of all public infrastructure away from the .news domain and rehomed to .io servers.  This seems to have caused some ripple effects through many of the uptime tools, but I worked with each provider to identify any issues and get them resolved.  Working with all validation providers to help identify common standards and testing methods across all tools.

Had to deal with several rounds of public API onslaughts, so ended up locking the public IPs down pretty heavily to mitigate the abuse.  This in turn nuked most tools testing our site so I have since backed ALL ban lists off for now, although now the public nodes are hammered so hard they are full and don't respond to the testing tools now, resulting in a lower uptime rating than before :) :facepalm:  Continuing to fight to find a balance between throttles and usability.

Icing on the cake was our hosting provider where we ran our block production node had issues with the server and I couldn't even get in to fix.  We made the decision to bring the BP node back on premise with the rest of our farm, but that upset the delicate balance of p2p syncronization.  I spent a few days building out the new BP along with 3 new dedicated p2p servers to assure consistent meshing with the entire network and address any latencies or backed up queues.

Lastly, completed upgrade of all WAX testnet and mainnet nodes up to the 3.1 platform as well as upgraded all Hyperions to 3.3.6 version.

## Product Development Updates
**WaxStats** - Initial efforts by SysAdmin to repair node discovery code did not go well, so I manually fought through some of the issues in the Python code to push through a new batch of endpoints to test.  The endpoints tested now should include most/all BP endpoints and will continue working to resolve the automatic discovery process (parsing issues in JSONs)

**AWButler** - Still working with many communities to provide services to distribute their assets to the AW community as well as reporting to view all game/transaction data.  Recent contract changes by AW required some rework to adapt new logic.

**Collection Scoring** - Still working on finalizing the Collection Scoring processing/reporting for collections.  Working with GraffitiKings and found all the special characters they used in their template names really crippled alot of backend database coding (non-ASCII characters, apostrophes, etc.).

**Alcor/Account Tools** - Running many different automation tools/scripts to help players/projects with services like automatic claiming/staking, asset distribution, etc.

**Player Support** - Still providing Tier 1&2 support personnel/services for projects.

**WAX/Minecraft Services** - Development has continued on final preparation for initial release.  Can provide more details upon request.

**MonsterStrike** - Still public beta testing with client.

**In-House GameDev 1 (Space)** - In-house game development. Continued development on PvP feature; initial NFT design completed (confidential detailed information available if requested).

**In-House GameDev 2 (Horse)** - In-house dev project. Presented initial POC to client for review.

**In-House GameDev 3 (Cars)** - In-house dev project. Presented POC to executive staff and continuing forward towards public release. (confidential detailed information available if requested).

## Ecosystem Development Updates
**Hosted Services** - Still providing hosted APIs for MetaSource, InfoCore, Uplift, and in discussions with others thinking about private nodes.  New IPs provisioned and new FW being installed to migrate traffic.

**Blockchain Consulting Sevices** - Working with many different projects around the space as always.  Been discussing CPU rental/RNG options with Isaiah @ cpu4sale as well as discussing providing infrastructure hosting/consulting for GK's software developers (Arch Games) to assist them however we can.  Also helped out Bittrex who was having some CPU issues which impacted deposits/withdrawals, so staked 250K WAX in meantime until they are able to finalize a more formal plan on CPU for their services.

**EOSIO IBC** - Still running the IBC nodes to provide services for the few tokens utilizing it, but really waiting to see how the new Antelope IBC solution plays out and maybe even potentially offer some services around that new protocol.
