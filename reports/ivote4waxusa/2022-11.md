## Technical Update
Dust is finally starting to settle on getting everything moved over to the new .io domain and servers.  Updated dedicated routing for all known testing service IPs to assure tests are able to get through any rate-limits, and the public endpoints are still seeing a pretty steady flow of traffi.

## Product Development Updates
*WAXStats - Still working to get the automatic detection of all nodes working properly in the master node list collection process.
