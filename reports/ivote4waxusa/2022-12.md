## Technical Update
Public APIs are still seeing pretty decent loads (much lower with the newer limiting settings):
*Mainnet:
- RPC: 33mil/week - 4.7mil/day - 196K/hr
- Hyp: 5mil/week - 714k/day - 30K/hr
- Atomic - 530k/week - 76K/day - 3K/hr

*Testnet:
- RPC - 1mil/week - 143K/day - 6K/hr
- Hyp - 34K/week - 5K/day - 200/hr
- Atomic - 12K/week - 1700/day - 70/hr

Been working to get our in-house full mainnet state history logs regenerated by replaying the full blocklog.  Has been grinding for about 1.5 months (2 independant servers actually) and should finish up sometime this week.  Built a new testnet Hyperion server on 3.3.7 and upgraded backup testnet Hyperion to 3.3.7 as well.  Also had some issues with the DelphiOracle feed where I was hitting API rate limits towards the end of the month which caused some missed data points.  I rewrote the feed process to be more efficient and not require feeding both mainnet and testnet to duplicate all price API queries.

## Product Development Updates
- WAXStats - Still collecting performance/availability metrics for all WAX nodes around the network.  Also feeding several games public statistics from this platform that are embedded into client's sites like Alien Worlds and Dark Galaxies.
- AWStats - Recently fully opened the access to the reporting.eosusa.io portal to allow players to better retrieve AW game data.  Working with other projects to help feed this data to other services to extend gameplay or analytics.
- Collection Scoring - Providing collection scoring for projects and in discussions about adding additional metrics such more frequent/real-time data feeds for collection trading metrics (currently AH only calcs daily).
- Player Support - Still providing dedicated staffing for player support for projects
- WAX/Minecraft - Finalizing deployment features, was targeted for year-end release but ironing out final bugs with authentication issues with Wax Wallet before releasing.

## Ecosystem Development Updates
Hosted Services - Still providing dedicated RPC/Hyperion/Atomic endpoints for MetaSource, InfoCore, and Uplift and dicussing with others.  Actually reduced pricing in half for all services to attempt to help projects survive the winter.
Blockchain Consulting Services - Work with many, many different projects around the space to help them with questions or issues they have integrating with WAX.  Began talking with few new projects last month such as Starship NFTs, ShadySapy,  MetaDecks.
Antelope Development Coordination - We, along with a few other Guilds, have been attending weekly meetings every Wednesday morning to discuss the current issues and future development of the Antelope software.  Many of the discsusions are us relaying details and brainstorming ideas of how the software can be improved to help address many of the issues all of us see running the WAX blockchain.  Many of the topics discussed have features designed to address them that will be included in the upcoming versions and more to come.
