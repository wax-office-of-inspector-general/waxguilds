## Technical Update
Public APIs are still seeing pretty decent loads as always:
*Mainnet:
- RPC: 10mil/day - 416k/hr
- Hyp: 560k/day - 23k/hr
- Atomic - 94k/day - 4k/hr

*Testnet:
- RPC - 260k/day - 11k/hr
- Hyp - 5k/day - 200/hr
- Atomic - 1600/day - 66/hr

Completed full replay of WAX Mainnet statehist logs (about 2.5months of grinding) and replicated those out to our farm of state history servers as well.  Next up is adding larger drives into the public API/P2Ps to load them with full logs as well.  All Hyperion servers have been updated to 3.3.9-3 as well.

Regarding the upcoming chain 3.x Antelope upgrades, all our infrastructure has been updated to 3.1.x months ago, except our snapshotting nodes, which will remain on 2.0.X until after the activation to allow for backwards compatibility as long as possible.  All mainnet public facing + BP nodes are 3.1.4 and will be cmopleting remaining internal infrastructure soon (been waiting on a more stable 3.2.x)

Lastly, we have deployed the latest Antelope IBC proof services for all supporting chains to provide that service to any projects looking to utilize those services across WAX, EOS, TELOS, and UX.  Worked with the dev team to test and deploy the new state history-based service (vs previous version which required dFuse Firehose).  As a side note, as we were deploying dFuse Firehose on WAX for this purpose, we hope to provide the WAX dFuse Firehose services as well when indexing completes).

## Product Development Updates
- WaxStats - Manually pushed through another updated API list while working on fixing the automated process to read the bp.jsons and scrape the addresses.  Initial new version seems to be working in test so hope to deploy to the production systems soon.
- AWStats - Added additional player statistics reports to the portal and working with other projects to hopefully utilize the data for their projects and expand the data being captured/analyzed.
- Collection Scoring - Pitching collector scoring services to projects we work with to help add some gamification to their collections
- Player Support - Providing player support staff for projects
- WAX/Minecraft - Product has entered Closed Beta testing phase with more players being added in for load testing and bug finding.  Also shotgunning the upgrade of the WaxJS libraries to support latest Cloud Wallet changes.  Scheduled for Open Beta soon as public release soon after if all goes well.

## Ecosystem Developments
Hosted Services - Still providing dedicated RPC/Hyperion/Atomic endpoints for MetaSource, InfoCore, and Uplift.  Recently added API services for ShadySapy & MassCult as well.
Blockchain Consulting Services - Still working with many projects around the space offering help however we can.
Antelope Development Coordination - Still attending the weekly technical node discussions to help the Antelope developers understand the real-world use cases/struggles of the software and work to help optimize/secure the code in upcoming releases.
