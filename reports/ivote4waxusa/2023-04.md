## Technical Update
Public APIs are still seeing pretty decent loads as always:
*Mainnet:
- RPC: 11.7mil/day - 490k/hr
- Hyp: 595k/day - 25k/hr
- Atomic - 264k/day - 11k/hr

*Testnet:
- RPC - 73k/day - 3k/hr
- Hyp - 5k/day - 200/hr
- Atomic - 7k/day - 300/hr

Was away a bit with our newborn so didn't make much progress on adding anything technical, mostly focused on maintaining the nodes and services (had a few servers topple over and need TLC).  Still grinding through the dFuse sync, made it through about 217M blocks so far.  Finished publishing IBC services (ibc.eosusa.io) and will add the WAX indexing as soon as the IBC contracts are finalized.

## Product Development Updates
- WaxStats - Minion has repaired the automatic retrieval process to properly parse all BP JSON information but I have not had a chance to review the final list and deploy all probes.
- AWStats - Continuing to add additional game metrics to the data warehouse as well as beginning to integrate the data with other projects to use it for additional processes/gameplay.
- Collection Scoring - Still offering the service for projects
- Player Support - Providing player support staff for projects
- WAX/Minecraft - Closed Beta testing has been continuing and all tests are going well.  AW has requested one final site redesign before pushing the services out for Open Beta.

## Ecosystem Developments
- Hosted Services - Still providing dedicated RPC/Hyperion/Atomic endpoints for MetaSource, InfoCore, Uplift, ShadySapy & MassCult.  Recently added API services for PixelTycoon as well.
- Blockchain Consulting Services - Still working with many projects around the space offering help however we can.
- Antelope Development Coordination - Still attending the weekly technical node discussions to help the Antelope developers understand the real-world use cases/struggles of the software and work to help optimize/secure the code in upcoming releases.
