## Technical Update
Public APIs are still seeing pretty decent loads as always:
*Mainnet:
- RPC: 7.7mil/day - 323k/hr
- Hyp: 659k/day - 27k/hr
- Atomic - 483k/day - 20k/hr

*Testnet:
- RPC - 75k/day - 3k/hr
- Hyp - 5k/day - 205/hr
- Atomic - 1.6k/day - 67/hr

Mostly been focused on getting the new Minecraft services open beta launched as well as IBC.  As for the IBC solution, it has been deployed on WAX (ibc.eosusa.io) but after initial testing (mostly by Alcor) issues were identified with the IBC indexers (on all WAX IBC nodes) so new version deployed and proofs reindexed to resolve.  Initial testing of 4.0 nodes seems stable, so will be rolling out 4.0.1+ versions to all nodes soon.  dFuse mostly synced up but havent been able to revisit publishing the public endpoints yet.
