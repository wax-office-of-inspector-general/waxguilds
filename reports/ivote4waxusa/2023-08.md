Upgrade Status (all internal self-compiled binaries):
Mainnet:  ALL API, P2P, SHiP, BP, & others UPGRADED to 4.0.4wax01
Testnet:  ALL API, P2P, SHiP, BP, & others UPGRADED to 4.0.4wax01

Big push was to get new 8TB SSDs deployed to all WAX mainnet nodes to store and provide full blocks logs for all public API/P2P servers, primary & backups.  Also since it's dead of summer, had 2ton AC die along with a few servers, so been fighting to get things back to normal.  Lastly, spent time chasing some performance issues on our 10900K i9s after the 4.0.4 upgrade (finally chased it down to cpupower service issues after the Ubuntu 20.04 upgrades).

## Product Development Updates 
- WaxStats - Still have to deploy the new JSON processor to assure system is properly picking up new/updated BP information.
- AWStats - Still indexing and providing detailed reporting of all AW game actions.  Began building/configuring AI services on AW and WAX blockchain data.
- AWButler - Still distributing NFTs on hourly basis for half dozen projects; adding new project this week.
- Collection Scoring - In discussions with other projects about utilizing the services for their collection/drops
- Antelope IBC Services - Offering public IBC endpoints for all enabled Antelope chains at https://ibc.eosusa.io.  Worked with the IBC devs to troubleshoot issues Avral/Alcor was reporting using the services, helped identify the issue, then had to reindex all chains (again) to resolve (and Avral is happy again :))
- WAX/Minecraft - Continuing open beta testing and resolving issues.  Dev complete on the new feature to allow other communities/minecraft installations to begin offering WAX integrated questing systems (like minecraft.eosusa.io, but their own).  Hoping to deploy in next few weeks.

## Ecosystem Developments 
- Hosted Services - Still providing dedicated RPC/Hyperion/Atomic endpoints for MetaSource, InfoCore, Uplift, ShadySapy, MassCult, PixelTycoon & NFT Draft.  Just added services for NiftyKicks project as well.
- Blockchain Consulting Services - Still working with many projects around the space offering help however we can.  Working on new Voyager project with the Apex Brasil develoment crew to develop advanced Atomic Assets statistics.
- Antelope Development Coordination - Still attending the weekly technical node discussions to help the Antelope developers understand the real-world use cases/struggles of the software and work to help optimize/secure the code in upcoming releases.

## WAX Task Force Proposal
As I've dicsussed on the OIG roundtable a few times now, I (along with Ross from EOSphere) have begun working on assembling a centralized location/document for all nodeos configurations, along with needed and helpful details regarding them.  This will provide some "recommended" values for the settings, along with a description of what the parameter does and how/why to use or change it.  It will also attempt to help indicate what options/features are suggested for a node role (API, SHiP, BP, etc.) as well as provide a visual grid along of what version(s) the feature is available (or removed) in.  Doc is not fully public just yet, but happy to provide link to the OIG for review if requested.
