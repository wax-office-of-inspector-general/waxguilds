## Product Development Updates 
- WaxStats - Still have to deploy the new JSON processor to assure system is properly picking up new/updated BP information.
- AWStats - Still indexing and providing detailed reporting of all AW game actions.  Still building AI services on AW and WAX blockchain data and hope to have POC ready this week.
- AWButler - Still distributing NFTs on hourly basis for half dozen projects.
- Collection Scoring - In discussions with other projects about utilizing the services for their collection/drops
- Antelope IBC Services - Offering public IBC endpoints for all enabled Antelope chains at https://ibc.eosusa.io.  Believe we are in use for the Alcor IBC services
- WAX/Minecraft - Continuing open beta testing and resolving issues.  Working out bugs with the new feature to allow other communities/minecraft installations to begin offering WAX integrated questing systems

## Ecosystem Developments 
- Hosted Services - Still providing dedicated RPC/Hyperion/Atomic endpoints for MetaSource, InfoCore, Uplift, ShadySapy, MassCult, PixelTycoon, NFT Draft & NiftyKicks
- Blockchain Consulting Services - Still working with many projects around the space offering help however we can. 
- Antelope Development Coordination - Still attending the weekly technical node discussions to help the Antelope developers understand the real-world use cases/struggles of the software and work to help optimize/secure the code in upcoming releases.
- OIG Roundrable - Still attending all bi-weekly OIG Roundtable discussions to help provide technical information and opinions and discuss any pending issues/questions.

## WAX Task Force Proposal
As I've dicsussed on the OIG roundtable a few times now, I (along with Ross from EOSphere) have begun working on assembling a centralized location/document for all nodeos configurations, along with needed and helpful details regarding them.  This will provide some "recommended" values for the settings, along with a description of what the parameter does and how/why to use or change it.  It will also attempt to help indicate what options/features are suggested for a node role (API, SHiP, BP, etc.) as well as provide a visual grid along of what version(s) the feature is available (or removed) in.  Doc is not fully public just yet, but happy to provide link to the OIG for review if requested.

Updating documentation with new parameters and recommended settings now that Antelope 5.0 RC has been released.
