Tools.ledgerwise.io

Maintaining Grafana and Nodestatus, will work on changing the UI to better suit IGs evalution process from April. Have asked Jorge to allow creating Login users for OIGs and others.

NFTVT.IO and Relodd.io

Maintaining nftvt.io and relodd.io (not working on adding new features for both)

WAXZILLA.IO

Working on changing the flow and process as discussed on the call. 
We discussed marketing internally, still believe we have to come up with a good product first and then comes the marketing (which involves onboarding businesses or projects building on WAX). We are working on a problem which really 
exists in all Antelope Blockchains. Its hard to market and reach out to community in Web3.0, we just wish to reduce the energy entrepreneurs have to put in building community
and reaching out to them. 

We have 70+ products and services listed on our platform and list of 200+ verified users for now... 

The product is coming out to be good, and we are focused on making it a success.

Last we added more size to resizer. We are maintaining it for now.
