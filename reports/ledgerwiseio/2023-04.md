**WAXZILLA.IO**

There's been a lot of development going on WAX, but sadly there's no place where new comer can be directed to go through the list of curated dAPPs,
projects, infrastructure tools, and services. We are working on Producthunt.com inspired product for WAX ecosytem where users will be allowed to upvote
and curate different products and services and get rewards doing so. 

We have deployed contract on Testnet. https://wax-test.bloks.io/account/huntwaxwaxwa?loadContract=true&tab=Tables&account=huntwaxwaxwa&scope=huntwaxwaxwa&limit=100
We will be whitelisting user based on passes, which user need to stake to upvote products and interact further with the contract, this will stop manipulation
from bots and marketing spaming. 

WAXZILLA.IO website, contract and backend are live for testing on testnet. Please check the website. 
We also have the passes ready - will share with OIGs on TG/EMAIL, as they have not been minted yet.
