**WAXZILLA.IO**

There's been a lot of development going on WAX, but sadly there's no place where new comer can be directed to go through the list of curated dAPPs,
projects, infrastructure tools, and services. We are working on Producthunt.com inspired product for WAX ecosytem where users will be allowed to upvote
and curate different products and services and get rewards doing so. 

We have deployed contract on Testnet. https://wax-test.bloks.io/account/huntwaxwaxwa?loadContract=true&tab=Tables&account=huntwaxwaxwa&scope=huntwaxwaxwa&limit=100
Updates (might not be considerred as it's in development but we wish to share) 

Unlike before users could list their own products, services, ideas and campaign. 
Verification is only limited to people upvoting and flagging any product or campaign respectively.
Campaign (crowd funding) has been impemented on the test net. We are not fiduciary of the grants, the smart contract send them to the fund raiser automatically like pomelo.
We are testing and refining things on the blockchain before we start inviting projects to list.
