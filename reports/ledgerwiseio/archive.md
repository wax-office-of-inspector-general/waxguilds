[https://wax.bloks.io/account/koilasassets](https://wax.bloks.io/account/koilasassets)Milestone - Get frontend and Import ready by next week. Why Koila? Non-gamified Social Media like Marketplace for Creatives. NFTs won’t be just collectable but much more like Fashion, Books, Memes and so on. We need a better way to have the community showcase and communicate with their community. (Further developments depend on Token Prices)

CERTIFYD - done and deployed on the mainnet. Certifyd will be really helpful for Tangible NFTs like Clothes. We have failed convo with two entities in India (afraid to take money in Crypto cause of compliance). If we won’t get any entity interested to partner we will have our own store ready next month on pilot basis.

Why Certifyd? Tangible NFTs are grabbing attention. We wish to leverage certifyd.digital to issue authenticity certificates for tangible goods. It’s a really great platform for users to check and get certificates for all the NFTs real life product they bought using their email id.

2. Crypto Ludo - We have partnered with some of the influencers and leaders in Indian space to push Ludo among Indian crypto enthusiasts, unfortunately the design wasn't liked by first adopters (mostly influencers) so we have to redo the complete design. We have completed the Backend (NodeJS Tournaments + Voice chat left, WAX integration left) and Frontend (design changes left). The game is quite famous in Indian audience with more than 500M+ total download (Collective Ludo King + Ludo Club and Prachis), the quest to create the same experience for users is taking time. We are all set to begin our marketing this month, along with our Strategic Partners including Cryptoverse, BoxBlock, MoneyDigitalGuru and so on.

WAX Guild Status - **Why?** To help IGs and Guilds check and cross verify the infrastructure reports, updated frequently.

**How?** We feel currently its mostly used by IGs and Guilds, we are marketing it to proxies as well. But it plays a larger role to support and improve the entire network and hopefully used by the community in larger when we have incentives based performance metrics live on WAX Network.

**What?** We see the value for IGs and Vote holders who wish to delegate votes to strong technical teams, verify what they are doing and support the WAX Network.

We wish to update this based on feedback, also hopefully next time we will have checks matching checklist of IGs Notion.

Updates from last time - Server side done, landing up and designing done. We are working on Referral marketing and marketing campaigns(pre-launch).

**How?** Will mostly used to look changes in votes and track stats overtime, we will adding notification on WAX_alerts_bot to track voting of proxies or guilds. (Will put analytics this month). **What?** Helps with dPOS and Network governance long term by helping to see the changes and stats current/overtime. Community - WAX_Alerts_Bot - **Why?** Help users with fast notification/alerts for whale,accounts and NFTs.
