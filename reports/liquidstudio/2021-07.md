## What is the name of your Guild?

Liquid Studios

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

API's were 100% online except for short term outages of the p2p endpoint, not a single block was missed. We continue to scale our infrastructure and refine our monitoring processes.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Progress on Liquid Universe is very good, still re-engineering UI/UX while we are adding more functionallity. We've designed 30 new 3D-Models from Scratch (Constructables/Buildings that are used to mine/produce resources and buildings for electricity/research/shipyard that will be part of our Asset-Sale. We are hiring and learning more developers. Additional/Confidential info send via Mail.

Apart from that, we are completely re-branding the company and the game with a new branding-partner.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

We have looked intensively at different ways to merge traces and deltas, but unfortunately there seems to be no sustainable and reliable way to do this, . Thus, we probably cannot realize the real goal, a simple, easily modifiable and high performance SHiP-consumer with streaming endpoints providing merged data. We will probably build a new solution based on deep-mind logging (dfuses modifications to EOSIO) and are currently in the research and planning phase. (https://github.com/liquidstudios/GraphEosStreamer)

After discussions in the guilds chat we have released our  nodeos failover solution as there seems to be demand for it and as you can see (no missed block) it seems to work well. We hope to make a big contribution to the security of the network and to increased uptime and less missed blocks. (https://github.com/Liquid-Studios/producing-node-failover)

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We are at EthCC in Paris this week and we are disseminating information about WAX and EOSIO based Chains. So far, everyone is very open minded and quite interested in ecosystems of other chains and WAX. We have several meetings a day and are constantly exchanging information. We also organized a dinner with ~30 well-known ETH developers and leaders of internal communities. Additional Information (Images) sent per Mail.

We actively participated in the IG elections and convinced Rakede (our new IG) to run and nominated him.

We are still active in various channels and advise and help in private chats, especially with focus on game development with traditional gaming engines.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
There should be an unreg function for future IG elections.
Detailed statistics about the number and votes and whale voting would also be good to increase transparency.
