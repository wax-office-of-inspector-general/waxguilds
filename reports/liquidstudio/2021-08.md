## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We've been ddosed multiple times and due to a Disk-failure one of our api-nodes was out of sync but available a few days at the beginning of the month. Additional Nodes were already present so while fixing the broken we Disk, we again extended our Infrastructure to a even more reliable and sustainable one includig multiple fallbacks.

We are proud to say that we still havn't missed a single Block on Mainnet (except for one planned outage to test fallbacks when we first got into top 21) and that we move in the upper average range when it comes to benchmarks
 
Additional [Confidential] Information has been sent to the IGs per mail.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

This month was largely focused on product development. The complete UI of Liquiid Universe has been reworked and new features have been added. Build pipelines for WebGL, MAC, Windows, Linux and Android are ready, iOS is in progress. We have created 24 new 3D assets and added 30 new resources and adjusted the in-game economy. We worked hard on the Astronauts and Commanders feature which is 70% implemented and are reaching out to members and projects from the community to integrate them using this new feature. 
We also reworked graphics pipelines to further increase rendering quality at the same performance, added avatars and guilds, and replaced old effects with better ones.

**We are now finally ready for a *public demo* that will start on *Tuesday the 24th of August.***
