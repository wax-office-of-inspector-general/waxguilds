## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
As always, we are proud to say that we still havn't missed a single Block on Mainnet (except for one planned outage to test fallbacks when we first got into top 21). 

We are continously extending our Infrastructure and hope to be able to provide weekly snapshots for blocks and history and daily snapshops for state, soon. Due to maintenance and some adjustements to advance our services, our APIs will probably down for maintenance from time to time in the upcoming days. We will inform community and users early/in advance to allow them to switch to different service-providers.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

 ### Liquiid Universe
1. Last month was focused on various monetization and payment-options, Liquiid Universe now provides "instant"-options (pay-4-instant where the fee is directed to a pot rewarding stakers) for 
	- barter-trades 
	- normal-trades
	- flights
	- mining
	- producing
	- building ships
	- building constructables
	- repair of ships
	- repair of constructables 
2. Upgrading of Ships and Constructables through blending is in progress and already partly implemented. Players will have to blend their assets (combine multiple assets of the same type and level) to get a new asset of the same type with a higher level and extended skills like
	- mining-speed
	- production-speed
	- max mining-time
	- max producing-time
	- max health
	- recovery/repair-speed
	- additional mining/producing-options
3. Warpgates and related functionallity are implemented on Smart Contract Side but not integrated into the UI yet.
4. We've added Overviews for several Areas of the Game as requested by players of the demo to allow a different kind of maintenance and play in higher levels. These Overviews also come with the benefit that mutliple Actions are grouped into single transactions which reduces the CPU-consumtion.
   - ShipsOverview
   - TradingOverview
   - ConstructablesOverview
5. "Fanciness"
	- in addition to the high technical level we are now more and more focusing on adding the necessary "fanciness". So we are adding various kinds of effects, cursors, highlights, animations to make the game look and feel greater and to make it an eye-catching experience.
6. Guild Functionallity
    - Guilds  functionallity moved to a separate contract and we improve and extend their functionallity and value. Things like Tokenomics behind Guilds, joining-fees (directed to the stakers-reward-pot), Guild-Events and Guild-owned Assets like "Auctioning- or Flash-Sale- Space-Stations" in combination with Guild-internal Governance are in progress. 

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

The Ore-ID-Plugin is still in progress, we are working closely together with the team of AIKON. They are integrating some small modifications and additions on their services to make the UI/UX as fluent as possible.

We developed and published new Repositories and Tools on our Github.
### [HyperionApiClient](https://github.com/liquidstudios/HyperionApiClient)
A Hyperion Client Library compatible with Unity3D and traditional C# and .NET, fully functional, documented, with passing UnitTests. 

 ### [dfuse-enabled-eosio-web-ide](https://github.com/liquidstudios/dfuse-enabled-eosio-web-ide) 
 (Our favourite new repo as it makes using dfuse super easy for any developer) 
A dfuse-enabled EOSIO-Web-IDE to allow any developer to setup a local blockchain and dfuse-instance + gitpod-development-environment containing everything necessarry to build smart contracts and dapps with just a few clicks. 

### [AtomicAssetsApiClient](https://github.com/liquidstudios/AtomicAssetsApiClient)
Due to the large amount of parameters and endpoints the AtomicAssetsAPI supports + the goal of integrating/building a Client for the AtomicMarketAPI, we decided to throw away the old Client and to rebuilt it using a different pattern to increase maintainability while making usage and testing easier. The new Version is now based on the Factory-Pattern while making use of a ParameterBuilder, instead of traditional, more commonly used Patterns. 


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We are as always very active in various channels and advise various projects and developers and are ready with individual assistance, especially in the field of game development. 

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

Nope.
