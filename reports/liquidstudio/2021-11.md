## What is the name of your Guild?

liquidstudio - LiquidStudios (rebranding to liquiid.io)

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
As always, we are proud to say that we still havn't missed a single Block on Mainnet (except for one planned outage to test fallbacks when we first got into top 21). 

We again upgraded some of our nodes to keep up with the high traffic and storage needed and are currently adding additional nodes. Also, all our nodes are running on machines with at least 128GB RAM to be able to support the RAM-inflation upgrade in the best way.

We still have 100% uptime of our producing nodes and are proud to say that we still never missed a block.

There was a problem with missing blocks on our API when the pre-tech-evaluation happened, which is now fixed. 

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### New Website

The new website for the company is finally online (some texts still under development)
https://www.liquiid.io/

### Liquiid Universe

#### UI

We are currently re-engineering large parts of the UI to make the look-and-feel better, while continuously expanding the functionality as usual and in addition adding first-person elements.

#### Buildings / Constructables

We have recreated all the buildings/constructibles. They now look much better, fit better to their use and are animated and partly dynamically customizable (colors and logos of the faction a player belongs to are automatically adjusted).

#### Guilds & Membership-Fees

The guild logic is now separated into a guilds-contract and the unity integration has been adjusted. We also developed a joining-fee-model with increasing fee per user.Collected Fees are forwarded into a global pot which then is redirected to stakers of the in-game token. The joining-fee-model is also developed in a way so that we can allow foreign tokens as fee in spcific cases. 

#### Guild-Owned Assets

Furthermore, we are currently working on "Guild-Owned Assets". Players in a guild can propose and accept or reject the construction of a "Guild-Owned Asset". After successful acceptance, players can build the "Guild-Owned Asset" together, and after successful building, they receive a fractional NFT (a tradeable part of the building as NFT, like a share), which allows them to earn passive income through fees generated by this asset.

Currently planned Guild Owned Assets are:

- Warpgates
- Marketplaces
- Carrier Ships
- Deconstruction Stations

We are open for any further suggestions

#### Instant Actions

Instant Actions are now fully integrated and we added an algorithm that automatically increases the fee for an instant-action based on it's usage for 24 hours, to integrate a kind of free market between the user and the game, where the price for a certain instant-action is based on usage. Each of the different instant-actions has its own market and price.

#### Stellar Objects

We have extended the logic of Warpgates to the point where we can integrate different variations of "Stellar Objects" (objects that can be added to the orbit of a planet). 

Currently planned Stellar Objects are:

- Warpgates
- Shields
- Space-Stations
- Extended local marketplaces
- Energy absorbers

We are open for any further suggestions

#### Tools

In the last weeks we have also implemented the "Tools" feature. A user can build certain tools if he fulfills certain requirements. He can then use these tools to perform certain actions. Tools usually only allow the player to perform certain actions in a solar system and is usually only possible when the player is in that solar system. 

A good example is the "Robbing Tool". The player flies into the solar system for which he wants to create the tool and "spies" on it, using the necessary resources he builds the tool and is from now on able to rob planets in this solar system (if the other necessary criteria are met).

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

### Pomelo

We created a grant on pomelo and will receive some funding through it with the goal to create "the liquiid bible", a single platform for Game Developers, full of educational content like tutorials and examples on both, smart contract development and integrations to give every game developer out there an easy to use guide from start to finish and to allow any developer to build games on EOSIO-based chains.

https://pomelo.io/grants/play2earn


We developed and published new Repositories and Tools on our Github.
### [DfuseGraphQlSubscriptionClient](https://github.com/liquidstudios/dfusegraphqlsubscriptionclient)
One of our flagships, a Dfuse Client Library to subscribe to and consume dfuse-notifications via graphiql, it enables developers to consume actions and table-deltas with the lowest possible delay and enables them to build the best user-experiences possible, compatible with Unity3D (all different platforms) and traditional C# and .NET. Examples and installation-instructions coming in the next weeks (there are some third-party libraries for multi-platform-compatability needed).

### [DfuseGraphQlClient](https://github.com/liquidstudios/dfusegraphqlclient) 
A simple Dfuse Client Library to query data via dfuse's graphql-endpoints (no subscriptions), compatible with Unity3D (all different platforms) and traditional C# and .NET. Examples and installation-instructions coming in the next weeks (there are some third-party libraries for multi-platform-compatability needed). Note: due to the third-party libraries needed by the plugin above and the way Unity compiles projects, these two plugins are split into separate ones to reduce build-sizes.

### [AtomicMarketApiClient](https://github.com/liquidstudios/atomicmarketapiclient)
A ApiClient for the AtomicMarketAPI based on the new pattern (Factory-Pattern + ParameterBuilder) due to the large amount of parameters and endpoints the AtomicMarketsAPI. As always fully compatible with Unity3D and traditional C# and .NET, all tests passing, examples provided. 


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We are as always very active in various channels and advise various projects and developers and are ready with individual assistance, especially in the field of game development. 

In addition we represented the WAX community and WAX publicly at the following events, as well as promoted and showcased LiquiidUniverse and our SDKs and the development on EOSIO-based chains.
