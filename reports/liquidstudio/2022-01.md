## What is the name of your Guild?

liquidstudio - LiquidStudios (rebranding to liquiid.io)

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

As always, we are proud to say that we still havn't missed a single Block on Mainnet. Unfortunately we are continously 1 block behind on our hyperion-history. We are still trying to figure out how to fix this.

### LiquiidUniverse
We are still working towards the next demo of LiquiidUniverse while we are boosting the marketing. 
Among other things we have been working on the following things in the last weeks:
- Sectors. A number of solar systems will be grouped into sectors, each sector will have its own marketplace and guilds will be able to fight over the domination of sectors. 
- Sector-based fees for instant-actions. The fees for various instant-actions (instant-trade, instant-claim, instant-mine, instant-produce etc.) are now defined sector-based on the daily usage. If less instant-actions are executed in certain sectors, the price is lower there, in sectors with more instant-actions it is higher. 
- Robbing. Robbing from other planets.
- Factions. In addition to guilds, we have implemented the logic for joining different factions. A guild is an association of a group of players, while by choosing a faction you can choose the race and/or a special grouping focused on different skills. Each faction has different skills, so for example there will be "Pirates" who are better at robbing, "Mechanics" are better at building and repairing, "Traders" are better at trading, "Explorers" in exploration and population of new planets. 
- We split the Smart Contracts further and implemented another Guild-Msig-contract (not yet completely bound to the UI) which can be used to control Guild-internal processes. In addition, the guild contract has been extended with further functionality to define different guild consensus mechanisms (2/3+1 voting, 51%-voting, leaders-voting, top-level-player-voting etc.).
- We have micro-optimized the planet generation process, complex planets are now generated within 1/3 of the original time while less complex planets need only 50% of the time. 
- The procedural generation of solar systems has also been optimized.
- The general use of coroutines has been completely reworked.
- The 3 previous points now allow us to render planets in the solar system with vegetation and buildings instead of without any performance penalty. 
- The generation of galaxies has also been completely reworked and extremely optimized while the look is now much better. 
- Various 2D and 3D art has been reworked, including any in-game icons for resources and goods, any Constructables, Spaceships and WarpGates.
- Spaceships will be modular in the future (3D models are already modeled this way, implemented in prgoress), players first build single modules like cockpits, engines, chassis etc. which are then assembled to a ship.

### LiquiidUniverseMarketplace
We have also started work on our own LiquiidUniverse marketplace/showroom as there is a lack of marketplaces/showrooms with the necessary functionality to visualize 3D models and extended properties. The project is designed to provide a white label solution that other projects can use to visualize their assets. [Images are attached]

### The Liquiid Bible
The Liquiid Bible (Gitbook with examples and educational content for Game Developers using WAX/EOSIO-based chains and Unity) is in progress, currently we are developing and documenting the first example (the HyperionApiClient). Due to lack of manpower and necessary funds, the progress here will be slow but steady. 

### Websites
We made some changes to our new website www.liquiid.io and the new website for LiquiidUniverse is finally online, too: www.liquiiduniverse.io We are still applying changes to the latter, especially when it comes to sections for ambassadors and influences or the NFT-sale it's not 100% finished yet.

### Clients/Plugins/SDKs
#### AtomicMarketApiClient 
As we missed out on pushing our AtomicMarketApiClient for the last rating (and missed the points for it), we just did so: https://github.com/liquidstudios/AtomicMarketApiClient
#### OreIdApiClient
We also released our OreIdApiClient (it works but it's not completely integrated into Unity3D yet, still in progress): https://github.com/liquidstudios/OreIdApiClient

### dfuse-light (name tbd.)
We are doing a feasibility study while prototyping a dfuse-light to be able to provide a high-performance history- and streaming-solution with the same benefits and functionallity but without the high costs maintenance, complexity and overhead that comes with dfuse to the community. So far we re-engineered crutial parts of dfuse's core like the ConsoleReader and ParseContext, diverse Models and a custom Deserializer to read and parse Nodeos deep-mind output and to re-construct blocks in real-time. We did a lot of research on diverse storage-backends and are now working on integrating of https://github.com/microsoft/FASTER and are waiting for the next release (planned end of january) which should integrate https://github.com/microsoft/FishStore. We believe there is a high chance that the incomparable high speed of FASTER in combination with Fishstore as ingestion-layer with predicated subset functions could even be more powerful than dfuse itself (in addition to performance-benefits that come with removal of proto-conversation and grpc). Once the storage-binding is sorted out we plan to add diverse interfaces on top of it (GraphQl, Websocket, REST, tcp/udp-streaming etc.) and are planning to apply for funding through labs.wax.io to bring this solution from stadium of prototyping and feasibility-study to the state of a real and usable solution while being able to support, extend and maintain it long-term as well as beeing able to transfer the necesessary knowledge. The Solution is not public yet as it's in a very specific and young stage of the whole development-progress, any IG should feel free to contact us, we don't have any problem with showing off what we have in private - on the contrary, we would like to discuss with various projects, guilds and IGs as soon as we consider the solution to be on a suitable stage and integrate ideas and suggestions into the solution to be developed. There is much more we could tell about this solution, starting with missing functionallity in dfuse, over how we think we can reduce the super low latencies that come with dfuse even more, to how we think we can provide a solution every Dapp or Project will be able to host with only low costs - but we leave it at that for now. 

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We are reaching out to diverse influencers to market LiquiidUniverse, our Tools and WAX. 

Otherwise we are of course as active as possible in the community and try to support any developers who need our help.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

Nope. But we would like to invite the IGs to one of our weekly brainstorming calls (every wednesday 4pm UTC+1) to make it easier to follow the general progress of everything we do at liquiid.io and to give IG's additionl insights.
