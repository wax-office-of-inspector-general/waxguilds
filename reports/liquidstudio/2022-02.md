As always, we are proud to say that we still havn't missed a single Block on Mainnet. 

Unfortunately, with the Bug encountered in the eosio-contract-api by pink.gg our Atomic-APIs broke end of january. As storage on other nodes was slowly short in supply and hyperion constantly beeing one block behind we decided to order new Nodes for which we unfortunately had to wait a few weeks. Both, new Atomic- as well as Hyperion-Nodes are fully synchronized, up and running again. 

For some reason (at the time of writing) the hyperion /health-endpoint responds with 

    ...{
          "service": "Elasticsearch",
          "status": "OK",
          "service_data": {
            "last_indexed_block": 1,
            "total_indexed_blocks": 1,
            "active_shards": "100.0%"
          },
          "time": 1646077422279
        } ...
and is neither counting up "last_indexed_block" nor "total_indexed_blocks" while it's definitely all there and working as expected. We are investigating the problem and have contacted both EOSphere and EosRio. 

(Peering-Node is also up and running)

### LiquiidUniverse
The last weeks we where mostly focused on 
 - "Stellar Objects" -> Warpgates, Space Stations, Shields etc. stored as stellar_object_variant_t, attachable to a Planet and their functionallity. (See Screenshots attached)
 - "Guilds and Guild Governance" -> extending the Guild-Msig-contract with additional functionallity and different consensus-modes (51%, 2/3+1, top 10 Players, fixed delegates)
- "Guild owned Assets" -> Members of a Guild collectively build and govern this type of Assets and receive fractional NFTs and passive income as return (see Screenshots attached)
- PDA, "Tools" and Rob-Mechanic -> features that require a specific tool (for sure an NFT, player needs to build it first, can only be used a specific number of times, only works in specific solarsystems the tool was built for) like robbing, hacking, attacking etc. (see Screenshots attached)
- "Factions and Species" -> different Factions come with a different skillset (e.g faster production, construction, recovery, trading, deconstruction etc.) while the Species is just cosmetic (see Screenshots attached - Body is Faction, Head is Species - both are variable to give options for customization)
- General Bugfixing and Improvements
- adding more "fancyness" to diverse areas of the game (see Screenshots attached)
		- Light-Drone (See Video attached)
		- UI/UX and Style improvements (See Images Attached in general)

### The Liquiid Bible
Slow but steady progress due to missing manpower. We are in talks with pink.gg about a possible collaboration that would allow us to speed up plugin-/sdk-development as well as documentation and examples. 

### Websites
Continous changes and expansion on both websites (www.liquiid.io , www.liquiiduniverse.io)

### Clients/Plugins/SDKs

#### Anchor Wallet Unity3D-Integration
Today, a C#- .NET and Unity3D-compatible implementation to connect to Greymass's Anchor Wallet or Wallets using similar protocolls, similar to AnchorLink (typscript) is the biggest missing SDK/Took/Package for EOSIO-based Game Development. Unfortunately it is also the most complex missing piece and associated with the highest effort. Multiple projects and companies from the community have planned or started the development but so far all have failed or have given up the development due to lack of funds and so far there's nothing available to be used by the community to connect Unity3D-projects to Anchor Wallet. With the prospect of a new, free account creation tool (no specific details as we don't know what's already public, OIGs should know about it) being launched soon based on Anchor instead of WCW, it seems to us to be even more important now.

After waiting for some time for someone else to take over the development or get enough funding for it, while we are regularly asked for a solution by various projects and block producers, but the development never happening, we decided to tackle the development and will for a while focus mostly on the following Repostories to make multi-platform compatible soltution to connect and use Anchor Wallet in Unity3D a thing.

The following Repostories are work in progress and they are not working correctly yet. 

The split into 3 separate projects is similar to the (typescript-) original and we will continue this due to better maintenance options as well as modularity benefits.

We hope to keep a place in the top 21 to be able to continue the development. The development and maintenance of this SDK is not comparable to the development of an API client and to provide the necessary funds for the development we are dependent on the BP-income - especially while having to maintain all the other SDKs/tools/repositories we developed so far and while increasing efforts to develop better documentation and examples for these.

#### AnchorLink-Sharp (https://github.com/liquiidio/anchorlink-sharp)
- New Project/Repository, reenginering of AnchorLink (typescript)

#### AnchorLinkTransport-Sharp (https://github.com/liquiidio/anchorlinktransport-sharp)
- Project/Repository that will contain diverse transports for traditional C#, Blazor, Unity3D and more
- Changes of the typscript-repositories and changes to EosioSigningRequest have been integrated
- Work on the UnityTransport

#### EosioSigningRequest-Sharp (https://github.com/liquiidio/EosioSigningRequestSharp)
- Project/Repository containing a C#- implementation of the EosioSigningRequest-Protocol
- Updates integrating changes to the core-protocol of the last months

### dfuse-light (internally named DeepReader for now) (https://github.com/liquiidio/deepreader) 
We have published the repository for traceability

Our Dfuse equivalent with focus on streaming while associated with less overhead is continuously growing and we are pretty proud of the development-progress. 
- Serializing/deserializing deep-mind logs transactions, actions, db- and table-ops, perm-obs and limit-ops, reconstructing EOSIO-blocks etc. works well. 
- Custom action serialization/deserialization using persistent runtime abi-assembly-generation works, but needs to be extended and further optimized. 
- Postprocessing, flattening of data and first storage connection is also implemented. 

Extending the storage implementation and indexing as well as APIs will be part of the work in the upcomming weeks. It will still take a while until we are able to show off the first alpha-version of the solution.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

- We are in talks with pink.gg about a possible collaboration that would allow us to speed up plugin-/sdk-development as well as documentation and examples. 
- We are in talks with Blacklusion on how to support each others development.
- We have been at the Africa Games week, promoting both WAX and Liquiids Tools for Game Development among gamers and game developers. In general, the sentiment still seems to be anti NFTs and anti decentralized gaming, but typically after we show off what's possible and that real, interaction-rich games rich in game mechanics that really add value to the players are possible while allowing them to benefit of the greater decentralized environment, this typically arouses a lot of interest among many. (see Screenshots attached). 

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

mhh Nope.
