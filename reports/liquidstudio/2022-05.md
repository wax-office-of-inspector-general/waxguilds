It's all running fine, no downtimes or failures measured on our side, just a few days where the APIs where smashed with so many Requests that we had to set higher rate-limits than usual.

### [](#the-liquiid-bible)The Liquiid Bible

We spent a lot of time on CI/CD-Pipelines to automatically build, test, and generate documentation for our SDKs/Clients/Tools. One of the main goals was to be able to generate documentation for different Frameworks to allow exports to diverse other sources/public EOSIO or WAX-related documentation like wax-developers, upcoming pink.gg-documentation, documentation developed/provided by the ENF, the liquiid bible. Currently supported Frameworks are: 
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- [Bootswatch](http://mkdocs.github.io/mkdocs-bootswatch/)
- [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)
- [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook)
- [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/)
- Doxygen

*Pipelines are currently in private Repositories on GitLab as the full Framework is not finished and they need to be ported to GitHub first.* 

We published the repository for the base Docker Image that allows to generate the diverse Documentation while we pushed an example to the HyperionApiClient-Repo and made a PR with the generated Documentation to the wax-developers-repo. [.NET MultiDocGenerator BaseImage](https://github.com/liquiidio/dotnet_multidocgenerator_baseimage)

The general idea is to provide Documentation-Tool that could be used in with diverse Frameworks in diverse Projects (e.g. the liquiid bible, wax-developers, ENF-provided documentation, pink.gg or others) while beeing able to update all sources at once to have up-to-date documentation everywhere, instead of just building the liquiid bible on a single Documentation-Framework. Please Note that this development impacts all our SDKs/Clients/Tools in general.

 - ##### AnchorLinkTransport-Sharp ([https://github.com/liquiidio/anchorlinktransport-sharp](https://github.com/liquiidio/anchorlinktransport-sharp))
 - ##### EosioSigningRequest-Sharp ([https://github.com/liquiidio/EosioSigningRequestSharp](https://github.com/liquiidio/EosioSigningRequestSharp))
Not much progress on the Anchor-Integration this month as as we have focused mainly on dfuse-light, Liquiid Universe and SDK-pipelines and are waiting for https://waxsdk.com/sdk-report/ to be released . The quality and functionality is so far completely unclear, as there is still no open source code available. We are still waiting for the release to assess how the solutions differ and to what extent a further development of our solution makes sense and how we can deliver the best possible integration. However, we strongly believe that our solution is better in terms of quality and functionality, as we provide compatibility with traditional C# and the integration of the complete protocol based on the ESR standard brings advantages for the future as well as maintainability and further development.

We are working on updating the Atomic-Clients to match the versions of the Atomic-APIs as there have been some changes not reflected in our Clients yet.

### dfuse-light ([https://github.com/liquiidio/dfuse-light](https://github.com/liquiidio/dfuse-light)) (see public commits)

We have put massive time and man-power into dfuse-light (internally named DeepReader for now) and can proudly say that our dfuse-light MVP is working very well so far and is available online at www.noodles.lol/[...].

**Progress:**

We implemented a tremendous set of new features, following is a cutout with the most significant ones:

- Starting from snapshot
- Replaying Blocks.logs
- General improvements reading deep-mind-logs via stdout
- massive Object-Pooling to reduce Memory-usage at runtime while increasing performance
- Splitting of Stores into ActionTraceStore, TransactionStore, BlockStore and AbiStore
- Adoption of changes in the latest Mandel and WAX-Mandel-RC-Releases
- Further improvements of deserialization and serialization for both deep-mind-logs and API-responses reading data from the Stores
- Multi-Threading enhancements, 
	- spliting of the processing-chain from 
		- reading deep-mind-logs 
		- parsing deep-mind-logs
		- postprocessing deep-mind-enriched data
		- storing the data
	-  Multithreaded access for Store-Read-Operations
- A new ABI-AssemblyGenerator (we are very proud of this) that generates and injects Code (Classes and static deserializers for ABIs written in Intermediate Language CIL code) at runtime - which makes deserialization of Actions and Deltas unrivaled fast (it's like having static libraries for every contract, action, table and type used) and allows us to store Actions and Deltas as binary data instead of in deserialized format. (Note, variants are not supported yet) ( see [Source Code here if interested in Code-Generation and injection at runtime](https://github.com/liquiidio/dfuse-light/blob/develop/DeepReader/AssemblyGenerator/AbiAssemblyGenerator.cs))
- rework of the models to bring them into a format that allows us to implement Endpoints compatible with Hyperion, Dfuse and Nodes-Standard-API
- diverse metrics based on prometheus
- graphql-models, graphql-queries, graphql-subscriptions
- additional REST-Endpoints
- Health-Check API and Health-Check-UI
- Auto-Generated JsonSerializer-Contexts to provide most efficient Json-Serialization for the API


**Enpoints and Testing**
- [noodles.lol/grafana](noodles.lol/grafana)
		- monitoring of the service, progress and diverse statistics, nodeos monitoring to be added in the upcoming weeks and months. Service exposes prometheus-metrics via /metrics-endpoint which are read and visualized by Grafana
- [noodles.lol/swagger](noodles.lol/swagger) 
		-  swagger-interface with OpenAPI-specification, take a look here to see the currently available endpoints. Curren endpoints are mostly intended for internal testing and not made with intent of being used by developers/clients. Adding new endpoints or modifying the existing ones is the smallest job. We plan to provide a fully v1 and v2 compatible API while extending it with additional endpoints to be specified. To tackle this task we rely on the secondary-indexing framework of MS Faster. See discussion here: [MS Faster Query Capabilities](https://github.com/microsoft/FASTER/discussions/489)
- [noodles.lol/graphql](noodles.lol/graphql)
		- graphql-API offering access through multiple queries and subscriptions (streaming). Current implementation is mostly intended for internal testing and not made with intent of being used by developers/clients. It's already compatible with models used in dfuse and should provide some form of backwards-compatibility.
- [noodles.lol/metrics](noodles.lol/metrics)
		- prometheus-metrics to be consumed by diverse observability and data visualization platforms
- [noodles.lol/health](noodles.lol/health)
		- health-endpoint, currently only contains some rough stats, will be extended in the future.
- [noodles.lol/healthchecks-ui](noodles.lol/healthchecks-ui)
		- health-checks visualization, allows to integrate webhooks and offers diverse other functionallity (there's a Bug, the number of processed Blocks is not correct) (we are discussing features that would be helpful and strengthen our ecosystem and are open for feedback and ideas - see [.NET HealthChecks](https://github.com/Xabaril/AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks)  for potential Ideas and integrations)

Due to the incomparable speed of MS Faster, the current Solution can easily catch up with nodeos replaying from a blocks.log, unlike in other solutions the database is no more the bottleneck but the replay-speed of nodeos is.

Internal tests have shown that so far, 
- comparable grapqhlql-queries are in average 3-5 times faster than with dfuse, 
- comparable v1-like requests via REST are on average as fast as nodeos-api
- v2-like requests (the actions-endpoint) are due to the missing secondary-indexing-framework not well comparable at the moment but with response-times of hyperion often beeing between 1 and 2 seconds for uncached data we are pretty sure with MS Faster and our Solution we will be at the minimum 5 times faster (Secondary Indexing in Faster will be based on the same architecture as primary-indexing so we don't expect slower query-times here and therefore 5 times faster is a very low estimate looking at the response-time of the actual API. 
- Overall storage-consumption so far seems to be comparable to storage-consumption of a full Hyperion-Node while neither the extra Blocks.log, StateHistory.log or Traces.Log of Nodeos are needed (together around 12TB, Blocks and StateHistory around 7TB If I'm not wrong) while providing more data and functionallity than Hyperion + Full history together (full, mapped deltas instead etc.) theoretically cutting the storage-costs in half. The Module-Architecture-Implementation and other optimizations will allow to tremendously decrease the storage-consumption for chains where a high amount of transactions/actions is generated through usage of a few smart contracts while not negatively affecting performance or efficiency (theoretically having positive effect on performance but this needs to be tested first).

**A few NOTES!**
- Noodles.lol still is one of our development-environment-servers and there's a Debug-Build running behind noodles.lol which allows us to gather detailled information of exceptions, remote-debugging, attachement of profilers and generation of memory-snapshots. 
- Literally everything is running there (the whole stack from nodeos over sentry, prometheus, grafana, the dfuse-light-stack, the API-Service etc.), a production-environment where services are split over multiple Nodes while using Release-Builds should further improve performance. 
- The WebServer goes into idle-mode when not accessed for a while, the first Request made then potentially is compared quite slow as the WebServer needs to switch back into non-idle-mode first.
- We are using the latest WAX-Mandel build and do not plan to provide compatibility with earlier builds (while it would be quite easy and development initially was done with EOSIO 2.0 and 2.1) as we don't see value in supporting these old versions.
- We pushed the project to a new Repository with complete commit-history to provide more transparency for the evaluation and development-costs spend on the project.
- We are continously deploying updates and replay chains from scratch again and again on this Node so there's a high chance that the available head-block changes from day to day. We will try not to deploy any breaking changes for the upcoming 2 weeks while the evaluation happens but would be glad to receive a notification from the IGs once you tested everything so we can start to break things again. 

**Roadmap, Outlook**
Our internal development roadmap foresees the following next steps (partly depending on secondary indexing in MS Faster, prgoress from the ENF-side of things and internal budgets within the following months)

 - Implementation of Secondary Indexing Framework (depending on MS Faster)
 - Abstraction of the Solution into a Master-Slave architecture to allow replaying from multiple Nodeos-instances in parallel as well as providing multiple API-Servers accessing a single Store. 
 - Refining extending grapqhl queries, subscriptions, dataloaders and models
 - "Module-Design and Module-Injection" allowing to specify Modules with just a small Module-Specification based on Language-independent Conditions and Lambdas (see below for further explanation)
 - Default Modules (system contracts, token contracts, transfers, atomic contracts etc.)
 - Name-Bagging (technique to not store specific names multiple (often tens of times) per single Action, removing redundant storage to reduce storage-consumption and deserialization-effort when data is requested per API)
 - Caching (Currently the ReadCache in Faster is not even enabled, internal testing showed ~20% faster responses without any further optimizations) both, the GraphQl and the REST-API come with their own Caching-implementation (also disabled atm) not leveraging FASTERs Cache and a efficient Solution would integrate Faster into both Services while accessing the same Cache. 
 - Further reducing the Storage-size by offering options to compress data in different ways, removing unnecessary data from the models 
 - Extending filtering-capabilities
 - Handling of Deferred Transactions and Actions (Due to how deferred Transactions are processed by Nodeos and how the data-model differs from normal transactions and due to the reason that they are deprecated for a while now, they are not stored at the moment, we plan to integrate separate stores for deferred transactions and actions which is a relatively easy trivial task which just had no priority for now)
 - Integration of other Storage Backends (ElasticSearch, RocksDB, TiKV, TiDB)
 - Data-Lifecycles and automatic cleanup (allowing to specify lifecycles for specific data to not always keep everything - requested by multiple Node Operators)
 - GraphQl Queries and Subscriptions - extended Querying for specific fields (needs SI-framework) or integration of dfuse-like query-language
 - Fork-Handling (currenlty we are waiting for more information on Fast-Finallity from the ENF as it will greatly affect Fork-Handling.)
 - Improving the PostProcessing-Algorithm of deep-mind objects to be more efficient and performant (the current algo works quite well and is "efficient enough" but we see quite some room for improvements here)
 - Improved Auto-Scaling for multi-threaded parts of the application
