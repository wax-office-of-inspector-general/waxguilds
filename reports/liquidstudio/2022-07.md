## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

It's all running fine, due to a service-failure our API was down one day within the last weeks as a service stopped working and we needed to catch up with the SHiP-History. As we are working on the "distributed-infrastructure"-feature of the dfuse-light-application, we have added some additional Nodes to our infrastructure but this doesn't have any impact on the publicly used infrastructure yet. 

Following does not really impact Technical Operations, I don't know where to place this but I feel like it should be part of the submission. Unfortunately, due to the current ongoing market-conditions we had to give notice to quite a huge part of the team which will (if nothing changes) likely slow down the process of our developments in the future. We will apply for multiple Grants in the next Pomelo-Season and soon publish a Grant Application in the ENF-Grant-Submissions-Repository and hope to be able to keep the team as it is through income generated by these.

### LiquiidUniverse

#####  Energy-System, Randomly Colored Suns and Energy-Types, Sun-Extractor Guild Owned Asset
Sun-Colors are now randomly generated on-chain while each RGB-value represents a specifc Energy-type (we call them red, green and blue-energy internally atm. :D ). Different Energies are consumed by different Objects within the Game (Green by Constructables, Red by Spaceships, Blue by other things like Warpgates). "Special Buildings" like the "Powerplant" and the "Shipyard" produce a small amount of the related energy by default while the production increases with a higher level of a Building. Energy-consumption and energy-production are both as everything in the game scalable/adjustable through the administration-contract (later used by the overall governing DAC to govern the economy).

We are also introducing a new "Guild Owned Asset", the so called "Sun-Extractor" which will allow the energy-extraction from a Sun. A Sun-Extactor can only be build by a Guild and extracted Energy is shared with the Guild-Members and the Owners of the Sun-Extractor. 

In addition to the now 2 Guild Owned Assets "Scrapyard" and "Sun Extractor" a new one, the "Guild Owned Marketplace" is in progress.

##### Guild Owned Assets
We are continously extending the Logic behind Guilds and "Guild Owned Assets", over the last weeks we worked on algorithms that allow Guilds to adjust the amount of shares that guild-members and NFT-Owners receive as well as the necessary functionallit to calulate shares and evaluate each guild-members contribution to the construction of a "Guild Owned Asset" based on the economic situation. We needed to add quite a few statistics to be able to do "fair-math" as things like the overal produced/created resources, the overal consumed resources, the amount a specific resource has been produced, the amount a specific resource has been consumed etc. plays a role. The individual valutions are then converted into percentage-shares (and fractional NFTs) once the construction of the guild owned asset finished.

*Some additional info/explanation:
After a proposed "build guild owned asset"(buildgoa)-action was accepted by the members of a guild and executed, each member of the guild is able to bring resources to the guild owned asset under construction. (Let's imagine the construction-costs are 100 Wood, 100 Stone and 10 Gold - while User A brings 10 Wood, User B 10 Stone and User C 10 Gold. In a supply-and-demand-based system it is necessary to calculate each members contribution based on the current economic situation while different factors play a role. So we've implemented an algorithm that calculates valutions of contributions the moment a member brings resources to a guild owned asset under construction*

As the Owners of a "Guild Owned Asset" do not necessarily need to be member of the Guild governing the Asset and as Members of a Guild do not necessarily need to be Owners of a "Guild Owned Asset" we are introducing what we call a shares-bucket and a members-bucket of which the ratio is configurable by the Guilds Governance-process.

*Some additional info/explanation:
Guild Owned Assets are build in collaboration and any contributor earns a share through contributing. But not only Owners of a Guild Owned Asset should be allowed to benefit from the Guild Owned Asset but the full Guild should. Also owners of Shares can for sure sell their Shares to people outside the Guild while the Guild Owned Asset still belongs to the Guild it was initially build by. This construct results in quite a few problems but interesting economical and social situations we are trying to integrate and solve while implementing different game theories around them*

##### SectorsView, Sectors-integration. 
We have added a new SectorsView in addtion to PlanetView, SolarsystemView and GalaxyView. As Guild Owned Assets need to be placed somewhere and we plan to have Sector-based Guild-related challenges this is needed. It adds another level of navigation to the  UX and fills the gap between Galaxy and SolarsystemView.

##### Guilds Integration
We made further progress on integrating the currently three guild-related contracts and their functionallity into Unity, containing proposing/accepting/declining/executing of actions and their visualization, the construction of guild owned assets, contribution to and valuation of + shares of guild owned assets.

##### Marketing
As the Liquiid Universe is from a technical side closer and closer to an alpha version we are slowly starting to spend more and more time and money on the creation of marketing-material (see images and Videos attached)


### The Liquiid Bible
- We added a lot of documentation to the Client-Repositories to allow our Documentation-Pipelines to generate the Documentation that is integrated into the Liquiid Bible. (See public Commits)

### Clients/Plugins/SDKs

 - #### Anchor Wallet Unity3D-Integration
 - #### AnchorLink-Sharp
 - #### AnchorLinkTransport-Sharp
 - #### EosioSigningRequest-Sharp 

	- All three are on hold as we are still waiting for more Information regarding Stratton Studios implementation (https://labs.wax.io/proposals/65). We will likely continue our implementation, fix the last view bugs (only a few Unittests are failing) and add a UI to our Solution soon as there's alot of uncertainty and unclarity around the StrattonStudios Solution (no public open source code, no option to try, no implementation-details - native, webview etc.)

- #### AtomicAssetsApiClient
- #### AtomicMarketApiClient
	- We regularly run the developed unit-tests for both but currently no changes are needed.
	- Apart from that we added more documentation to the projects (see LiquiidBible above) (see public commits)

- #### HyperionApiClient
	 -  We regularly run the developed unit-tests but currently no changes are needed.


### dfuse-light (internally named DeepReader for now)
- We've reworked diverse serialization and deserialization-interfaces for better maintainability and clean code
- General Code-Cleanup and solving of Issues
- Regarding the secondary indicing framework of MS Faster, we are "in contact" with the guys from Microsoft here: https://github.com/microsoft/FASTER/discussions/489
- We are working on integrating Postgres, MySQL and TiDB as Storage-backend in addition to the main-storage-backend Faster. With the right Design all 3 DB-Engines are interchangeable and make use of the same adapter which reduces maintenance-costs while allowing a high degree of customization through the usage of the best storage-engine for a specific chain or use-case.
- We've spent a lot of time on the implementation of features regarding distributed infrastructures, allowing to connect multiple Deserialization-Clients to one or multiple Servers to improve replaying-speed of the full history or to just allow the setup of a distributed Client-Server-Architecture with multiple API-Clients and Servers allowing to horizontaly scale. Instead of the standard implementation where the server or database deserializes the data forwarded by Clients we attach importance to an architecture where a Server could just be a super fast querable data-store responding with binary-data which is deserialized by the API-Client forwarding it to End-Clients as this should help to maintain DB-/query-performance due to intelligent CPU-load distribution. Our custom high-performance ABI-deserializers (last submussion, IL-CodeGen from ABI's at runtime etc.) makes a huge difference here and allows for this design. (see public commits)
