##### UI Performance optimizations
General UI-related performance optimizations

##### Liquiid Universe Economy Editor
We've focused a lot on the Liquiid Universe Economy Editor over the last weeks as it's ment to be an additional product to the Liquiid Universe, allowing us to offer the Liquiid Universe as a Whitelabel-solution. This Whitelabel-solution is already planned for a while but as we see an increasing amount of requests from the community and other projects beeing interested in deploying and providing their own Galaxies (configured through the Universe Economy Editor) while beeing integrated into the Liquiid Universe, we decided to prioritize the development to be able to show and discuss the Whitelable Solution while further developing the Liquiid Universe.

### Marketing & Social
- Our Artists are preparing more and more 2D-Art to be used in various ways for marketing in the future.
- We are in discussion with potential community-managers to improve the way and amount we interact with the community
- We are working on migrating the weekly updates we currently do on Discord to Medium to to provide a historical source of progress-updates while beeing able to push these weekly updates on a bigger variety of platforms and communication-channels to reach a vider audience.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Due to current problems regarding Copyright-infringements and lawsuit against Josh Loveridge and Stratton Studios, the public repositories are not updated at the moment and development happens in private repositories and without public information on progress or changes. IGs have access to these repositories or will be granted access on request.

### Unity Plugin Suite Proposal
We are in contact with WAX and other parties involved, discussing the further development and finishing of the Plugin Suite. Multiple calls and chats with diverse parties have happened gathering feedback from others in the community to make sure the scope of the following Proposal meets everyone's expectations.

At the moment we are awaiting a response from WAX and further information resulting from the labs.wax-Reviewing-Process.

### Wax Cloud Wallet Integration - * NEW PRODUCT *
One of the missing pieces of the Unity Plugin Suite is a sustainable and reliable, well-developed WAX Cloud Wallet integration into Unity. 

As the WCW Integration has not yet been a product of the whole Suite but it's something needed and requested by WAX (while so far still any information/documentation on the architecture and technical interaction-flow is missing), we started to do a lot of Research to be able to roughly plan and estimate the development of such a plugin. This mainly contains
- reviewing the Browser based interaction-flow using standard developer-tools like chrome and mozilla-developer tools, googles advanced rest client while extracting necessary information
- reviewing wax-js and it's documentation while extracting necessary information
- usage of tools like WireShark to extract additional information on communication-level
- Research on the current state of open-source and free-of-charge WebViews for Unity3d (WebViews in Unity3D are a huge mess and most WebViews are paid or not maintained. As WCW isbased on OAuth, there's no way around the usage of a WebView for at the minimum the OAuth-Login)
- Reserach and Discussions regarding architectural planning of the WCW-integration, mostly regarding latency, a sustainable, reliable and maintainable integration into EosSharp (while using a UAL that has to be developed) - while very focused on reducing the WebView-Calls/-Usage as much as possible.

**From liquiids perspective, this is cleary the start of a new Product and Project as the development of a WCW-integration is completely independent and autonomous from the other Plugins while beeing a much requested Product.**

### Nodeos Interop Library - * NEW PRODUCT *
The current approach to communication between nodeos and dm-log-processing programs is based on logging of events to stdout. Here the nodeos-native objects/structures are converted via fc-reflection into binary buffers and then into hexadecimal strings which are then tagged and logged to stdout. The dm-log-processing program has to read the logs, process the tags and deserialize the hexadecimal strings to binary buffers which are then converted to native objects of the processing language (Marshalling/binary deserialization).

This process seems to be inefficient because of the unnecessary tagging and especially the serialization and subsequent deserialization from binary to hex and vice versa as well as the writing and reading of stdout, as well as the processing of strings (variable splitting, comparisons etc.) produces a lot of overhead.

We assume that the dfuse-team originally wanted to implement a solution that works language independent and allows developers of various languages to process dm-logs.

To improve the communication between nodeos and dm-log processing applications we have developed a prototype based on interop-calls.

Here nodeos is compiled as a library and integrated into the dm-log processing solution. When nodeos is started, function-pointers/delegates are passed to nodeos which allows the nodeos process to call methods of a foreign application in other languages. This allows us to remove tagging, serialization from binary to hex, and to skip writing to stdout while instead calling a delegate in the foreign code for each dm-log event type, while passing information - resulting in much simplified processing in the foreign application.

The current prototype allows us to pass information such as memory pointers and lengths, which allows us to copy the memory used by nodeos in the wrapping application (native memcpy equivalents in wrappgin language) and to then process the copied data asynchronously to ensure both deterministic execution of nodeos as well as asynchronous processing and non-blocking behavior.

An interop-calls based approach would still allow a certain degree of language independence, but only with limitations, as not all languages and runtimes have the necessary features. In addition, an interop-based approach allows certain events to be ignored without performance degradation and gives developers a simple, non-destructive way to filtering that does not degrade performance.

**The Nodeos Interop Library and it's development is a project and product completely separate from dfuse-light and designed with the objective to be an alternative to the current stdout-based dm-log with an interop-approach allowing other languages to easier build applications on top the interop-libary.** 

**It's clear that dfuse-light will make use of it and will be a beneficiary of the developed tech but the Nodeos Interop project itself covers a much larger scope.**

public repositories / branches are available here:

( As the development of "Nodeos Interop" is something we clearly have to discuss with the community and parties involved or interested - while it's under development - this development is still happening public)
