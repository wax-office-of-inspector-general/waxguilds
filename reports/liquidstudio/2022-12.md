## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Due to current problems regarding Copyright-infringements and lawsuit against Josh Loveridge and Stratton Studios, the public repositories are not updated at the moment and development happens in private repositories and without public information on progress or changes. 

IGs have been invited to private Github Repositories to be able to follow the progress, Information from these private Repositories is not to be made public.

### Unity Plugin Suite Proposal

Please See: 
- https://github.com/liquiidio/WAX-Plugin-Suite-Proposal

### Clients/Plugins/SDKs

### AnchorLink, AnchorLinkTransport, EosioSigningRequest
Bugs in these repositories have been fixed, Transports and visualizsation for the different Ui-Frameworks have been created, most Tasks listed in the labs-proposal are completed and the Implementation is close to be finished (further testing, packaging and documentation needs to be added)

### AtomicAssetsApiClient, AtomicMarketApiClient, HyperionApiClient, EosSharp
We applied some fixes and updated the Unittests and are currently working on Example-Code, additional Documentation, and Packaging. Pipelines/Github Actions are already developed and just need to be applied to the individual Repositories

### Wax Cloud Wallet Integration - * NEW PRODUCT *
The WCW Integration is completed. It's fully natively integrated and supports WebGL, Android, iOS, MAC, Linux, Windows without the usage of a WebView-Plugin and allows whitelisting etc. Videos have been sent to the IGs. (further testing, packaging and documentation needs to be added)

### Wombat Integration - * NEW PRODUCT *
The Wombat Integration is completed, we added in in addition to the Cloud Wallet as it's one of the most used Wallets on WAX while still offering free account creation. We believe it's worth it so we 've covered the costs (not part of the labs-proposal). It's fully natively integrated but supports only WebGL but without the usage of WebView-Plugin. We are in contact to the Wombat-Team and as there's a Desktop-Wallet under develpment it doesn't seem to be clever to spent the time on a Desktop-integration that will be replaced in the near future.

### UniversalAuthenticatorLibrary - * NEW PRODUCT *
We have developed the UniversalAuthenticatorLibrary (short UAL) for Unity and are currently finishing the Ui-Integration for the two Unity-UI-Frameworks while cleaning up Code and increasing maintainability. The UAL is based on the original Typescript-implementation while we applied some changes due to Unity-specifics and usability-improvements we saw. The UAL will, like the Typescript.UAL allow developers the easiest way possible to integrate WAX and the provided Wallets into their Game. A few clicks to copy predefined prefabs for UAL and Authenticators into the Games Scene and a few simple lines of Code is everything needed.

### AnchorAuthenticator - * NEW PRODUCT *
We've implemented the Authenticator for Anchor which integrates the Anchor-Solution mentioned above. The AnchorAuthenticator is for easier development and testing currently placed in the UniversalAuthenticatorLibrary but it will soon be moved to it's own Repository similar to how how each Javascript UAL-Authenticator is an individual Project living in it's own Repository. 

### WaxCloudWalletAuthenticator - * NEW PRODUCT *
We've implemented the Authenticator for WaxCloudWallet which integrates the WCW-Integration mentioned above. The WaxCloutWalletAuthenticator is for easier development and testing currently placed in the UniversalAuthenticatorLibrary but it will soon be moved to it's own Repository similar to how how each Javascript UAL-Authenticator is an individual Project living in it's own Repository. 

### WombatAuthenticator - * NEW PRODUCT *
We've implemented the Authenticator for Wombat which integrates the Wombat-Integration mentioned above. The WombatAuthenticator is for easier development and testing currently placed in the UniversalAuthenticatorLibrary but it will soon be moved to it's own Repository similar to how how each Javascript UAL-Authenticator is an individual Project living in it's own Repository. 


**Please note:** 
We are in no way trying to kid you with the "new products" and the Authenticators. 
 - The WAX Cloud Wallet integration as well as the Wombat Wallet integration are completely new projects, packages and repositories. Especially the WCW integration took quite a bit of research and development time.
- As in the Typescript implementation, the UniversalAuthenticatorLibrary is a separate Project and Product: https://github.com/EOSIO/universal-authenticator-library

Any other Guild developing a specific Authenticator would very likely submit it as individual product while we must assume that at leas 12 points would be granted for the development. Each Authenticator is for technical reasons already mandatory a separate project and package and must be developed and maintained independently, as with Typescript Authenticators. Examples:
https://github.com/wombat-tech/wombat-ual
https://github.com/eosdac/ual-wax
https://github.com/greymass/ual-anchor


All Unity related Projects are combined now 16 Projects (without other repos like dfuse-light, web-IDEs, etc. included)
 - AnchorLink-Sharp
 - AnchorLinkTransport-Sharp
 - EosioSigningRequest-Sharp 
 - AtomicAssetsApiClient
 - AtomicMarketApiClient
 - HyperionApiClient
 - EosWsSharp
 - WaxCloudWalletUnity
 - WombatUnity
 - EosSharp (originally developed by Scatter but at least maintained by us)
 - DfuseGraphQlClient
 - DfuseGraphQlSubscriptionCleint
 - UniversalAuthenticatorLibrary
 - WaxCloudWalletAuthenticator
 - WombatAuthenticator
 - AnchorAuthenticator

None of these Projects or Packages is result of intentionally dividing projects into multiple smaller projects, most of them are inheriting the same structure and implementation as the original implementation. 

We wold like to ask the OIGs to reconsider the number of points given to us for these projects and the work and knowledge required in relation to other projects and points given for them. 

Facts like that nobody but us (excluding companies/projects copying and distributing our code) seems to be able to develop this software and nobody provides even approximate projects (in number and quality) should not be disregarded apart from the sheer number and now soon high completeness. 

Past experience shows that even the smallest products and efforts are often rewarded with 12 points. 

We are not saying that we think 16 x 12 points is justified, that assessment is in the hands of the IGs - However, as stated, we ask that you reconsider the points for the projects mentioned. 

One idea would be to split or group the rating of our products into 3 sub-areas like the following, if necessary
- Api-Client Libraries
- Wallet Integrations
- Authenticator Library

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

### eosio.stackexchange moderator
We have not listed this to date but we think the moderator role on eosio.stackexchange (soon hopefully antelope.stackexchange) by founder Corvin is a very important and rewarding form of community engagement. Corvin has been one of 3 moderators on eosio.stackexchange for about 1 year (of which 2 are unfortunately relatively inactive).

### Antelope Node Operator Calls
We are actively participating in Antelope Node-Operator Calls every wednesday and related discussions and including team-internal pre- and post-meetings. The Antelope Node Operator calls are carried out by the ENF while ENF-Members and Core Antelope-Developers are available within the calls, topics are discussions around Node Operators specific experiences, needs and possible improvements to be applied to the leap software. We believe this is also pretty valuable Community Engagement and would like to seize the opportunity to invite the IGs to participate.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
- nope
