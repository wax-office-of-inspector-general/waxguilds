## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Due to current problems regarding Copyright-infringements and lawsuit against Josh Loveridge and Stratton Studios, the public repositories are not updated at the moment and development happens in private repositories and without public information on progress or changes. 

### Unity Plugin Suite Proposal

Please See: 
- https://github.com/liquiidio/WAX-Plugin-Suite-Proposal
- the last report for general progress so far
- The Progress in GitHub Repositories. IGs have been invited to all private Repos and are able to look into them.

In addition to the general progress on the individual PluginSuite Packages we are at the stage where 
- Packages/Plugins are tested for individual LTS-Versions of Unity
- Builds for diverse Build Targets and Unity Versions are passing
- Example-Scenes/Builds are done
- Diverse CI/CD Pipelines are implemented
- Packaging for most Packages is done and at the moment in testing (Nuget, UPM, unitypackate etc.)

The last missing piece is the Documentation - the "Unity Plugin Suite Gitbook" (see https://liquiidio.gitbook.io/unity-plugin-suite ). Especially the API-Docs for each Plugin took quite some time while Example-Code, Getting-Started-Sections, Installation etc. is atm under development.
We are very close to publishing the Suite including licenses, documentation and everything needed by the community and described in the labs-Proposal.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

### eosio.stackexchange moderator
Until to date we havn't received any points for the moderator role on eosio.stackexchange (soon hopefully antelope.stackexchange) by founder Corvin but still believe it's an important and rewarding form of community engagement. Corvin has been one of 3 moderators on eosio.stackexchange for about 1 year (of which 2 are unfortunately relatively inactive).

### Antelope Node Operator Calls
We are actively participating in Antelope Node-Operator Calls every wednesday and related discussions and including team-internal pre- and post-meetings. The Antelope Node Operator calls are carried out by the ENF while ENF-Members and Core Antelope-Developers are available within the calls, topics are discussions around Node Operators specific experiences, needs and possible improvements to be applied to the leap software. We believe this is also pretty valuable Community Engagement and would like to seize the opportunity to invite the IGs to participate.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
- nope
