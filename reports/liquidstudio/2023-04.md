## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

- Since the Updgrade to Leap 3.2.x there have been heavy problems with the Atomic-APIs which crashed and broke multiple times due to known Bugs in the Software. We now fully re-indexed the AA-DB and it seems to work again.
- Testnet APIs are still online and in sync (see https://api.wax-test.liquidstudios.io/docs and https://api.wax-test.liquidstudios.io/v2/docs)
