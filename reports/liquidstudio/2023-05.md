### Mainnet APIs
Our Mainnet Infrastructure including APIs and Services (Full History, Full Hyperion, Full Atomic) is running correctly and without heavy downtimes again after upgrades, some maintenance-tasks and some customizations and additions to/of the infrastructure.

### Testnet APIs

Our Testnet Infrastructure (include same APIs and Services as above) is still running correctly and without heavy downtimes. After the last evaluation we noticed that we never changed/redeployed new bp.jsons and did not update the producerjson resulting in that we did not receive any points for prviding these services. This is now the case, both bp.json etc. and producerjson are updated so that BP-monitors are able to track uptime of said APIs.

### Unity Plugin Suite
- Ongoing maintenance of the Unity Plugin Suite (Released!) and the individual Packages contained.

### Liquiid Bible

- The Evaluation/Scoring-Sheet of the last Guild-Eval still says "The Liquiid Bible ... Update & Release required". The Liquiid Bible is now the official Documentation of the Unity Plugin Suite as it doesn't make sense to have multiple Sources of Information handling the same or very similar thematic. As it's the "Official WAX SDK" we can't call it Liquiid Bible anymore therefore the naming-change. The Documentation is ready and has everything necessary and planned, while the goal still is to extend it in the future if there's enough man-power and if it makes sense from a business-perspective (points granted, Labs-Proposals for further extensions etc.)

### Dfuse-Light and Nodeos-Interop

- While we are aware of that there are currently no points granted for dfuse-light and Nodeos-Interop we anyways want to give you a small Overview of the current Developoment:
  - We have prototyped a Secondary Index Framework allowing to index and query common data like by-account, by-contract, by-actionname, by-account+actionname, by-account+contract-actionname and so on
  - We have prototyped a new custom serialization and deserialization framework with even greater performance than the previous one (which already was magnitudes faster than dfuses implementation)
  - We have prototyped TypeScript generators in addition to the ABI-Assembly-Generator allowing web-developers to integrate generated libraries for Client-Side serialization
  - We are atm prototyping a lot regarding compression lifecycles of diverse data

As this area of development is very uncertain and a lot of try-and-error, prototyping and walking in circles, we are prototyping this functionallity as feasibility study to ensure a specific approach matches the expectations and goals allowing us to build a software-stack as good and performant as possible while allowing us to propose a grant-application either via wax.labs or ENF grants to finish the development and to make the product production-ready.
