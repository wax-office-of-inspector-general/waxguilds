## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

### Mainnet APIs
- Our Mainnet Infrastructure including APIs and Services (Full History, Full Hyperion, Full Atomic) is running correctly and without heavy downtimes again after upgrades, some maintenance-tasks and some customizations and additions to/of the infrastructure. 
- Just FIY, between the 13 and 21 of August our Hyperion is showing availability of only 75%-85% on ValidationCore. This seems to be due to missing ActionTraces in Hyperion for the previous month and partial-checks, unfortunately a re-sync did not help adding the missing ActionTraces and the HypRepair tool did not help either.
- Due to the latest scores we no longer have eosio.prod permission for about 5 days so we can't push Oracle feeds anymore.  As long as had eosio.prod permission we pushed Oracle feeds continuously and reliably.

### Testnet APIs

- Our Testnet Infrastructure (include same APIs and Services as above) is still running correctly and without heavy downtimes.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

### Unity Plugin Suite
- Ongoing maintenance of the Unity Plugin Suite (Released!) and the individual Packages contained.

### Liquiid Bible

- We are actively maintaining and updating the Liquiid Bible (in the meantime just called WAX Plugin Suite Documentation, see https://liquiidio.gitbook.io/unity-plugin-suite )

### Dfuse-Light and related

- We know this will likely not have any impact on the scoring but we are still actively working on dfuse-light and related software, we just reached a point where changes in the software take days or weeks to take effect as replays take quite some time - therefore development is slowed down a lot at the moment.

### Other
 - We ahve some other stuff cooking that we will report in the next submission ;) 
## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
