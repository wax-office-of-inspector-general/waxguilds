### Virtual Reality Graffiti Battles
July 18th marked the Launch Event for Season 1 of our Virtual Reality Graffiti Battle events (VRGB), which combines multiple elements of street culture and features a graffiti competition, artist interviews, freestyle cipher battles and some WAX NFT collections of course!

During the July 18th event we promoted the [Hell Ride Flow Pack](https://wax.atomichub.io/drops/78357) from the “skatecoinwax” collection and got 185 unique, whitelisted users (no bots) to claim some packs. 

Voting in the VRGB finals on August 1st can only be done by WAX users claiming their Voting NFT and sending it to their preferred artist to serve as on-chain proof of their vote.

The VRGB Season 0 NFT sale is currently planned for the weekend of August 31st and features all of the artwork from the season 0 (beta) event held last month.

### Blend.gems
We deployed our [blending smart contract](https://wax.bloks.io/account/blend.gems), used it to bake some birthday cakes for [AtomicHub’s 1 year anniversary](https://eosnation.io/eos-hot-sauce-108-bullish-attracts-capital-inflation-proposal-comments-testing-eden-reaches-100-members-atomichub-celebrates-1-year/), and announced an upcoming blending event for our VanCity Outbreak NFT holders. 

Our blending contract features the option to back blended NFTs with WAX tokens, which we highlighted during our AtomicHub anniversary community appreciation event. 

Participants invested 2 WAX for drops which were blended into a Birthday Cake NFT backed by 5 WAX. Restricted to 1 per account, the first 2 drops had 419 & 388 claims which have now been blended into 202 cakes, 34 of which have been burned and the remaining 168 are being held in 150 different accounts.

### VanCity Outbreak
To reward our loyal collectors, the VanCity team will create [a series of blending opportunities](https://eosnation.io/eos-hot-sauce-110/#7) to turn VanCity Outbreak collectibles into some marvellous standalone artworks. Using a new set of 3D animation tools, Reid Lucier, the series artist, created a set of standalone images that will soon be available on the upcoming .gems marketplace.
