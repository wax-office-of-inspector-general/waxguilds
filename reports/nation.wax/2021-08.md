### Virtual Reality Graffiti Battles
The VRGB Season 1 finals were held on the weekend of August 1st and attracted over 400 visitors to our Cryptovoxels metaverse parcel, many of them coming in from the Ethereum community and being introduced to WAX for the fist time. 

The VRGB Season 0 NFT sale was also launched that weekend and generated approximately 7000 WAX in sales.

### Live events: .gems' Cryptovoxel NFT Gallery

We are getting consistent foot traffic to our cryptovoxels metaverse gallery, which features many WAX NFT projects. [Our parcel](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/3945) has gotten 6866 visits since creation and about 900 in the last month.

We host Hot Sauce after-parties on the gallery rooftop each week, which has been attracting foot traffic to the gallery. More activity on the parcel in turn attracts more attention from the greater cryptovoxels community, who are highly engaged NFT enthusiasts.

### Community Tools: .gems blend tool

We've introduced [a new blend UI](https://blend.dotgems.io/) to make it easier for anyone to interact with our blend.gems smart contract to blend NFT recipes on WAX with the click of a button. The UI is still in alpha, but is being refined with a better experience and more features each week.
