### .gems NFT Marketplace
We believe that fine arts should have a place on WAX and will continue to introduce established artists to the ecosystem. In order to do so, art curation is key and therefore we’ve launched the [.gems marketplace](https://dotgems.io), a place to discover curated art and high-quality collectibles.

The .gems marketplace entered public beta and we will continue to improve and add new features over time.

### Heidi Taillefer - Frogs NFT Series

[Heidi Taillefer](https://www.heiditaillefer.com/) launched her Frogs NFT series on WAX this month in partnership with our NFT publishing studio, .gems. 

Early in 2021 Heidi Taillefer publicly announced that she would never create NFTs due to the implicated harm to the environment, but after communicating with the .gems team learned that sustainable NFTs are indeed possible on the WAX Blockchain. The whole story of how this collection came together makes a strong case for the WAX Blockchain and we’ve documented the process in a [blog article](https://eosnation.io/heidi-taillefer/) as well as in a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCokjLRgLgerCf5ijGYhp28w) with Heidi.

Heidi has a strong following with over [14K followers on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/heiditaillefer/) and many of her collectors got in touch with us to learn about WAX. To make the onboarding for these new WAX users easier we’ve created a [landing page](http://bitly.ws/gtuy) that guides through the Wallet creation process.

Parallel to the NFT sale, the physical works that inspired the Frogs series will be exhibited in the [Jano Lapin Gallery](https://janolapingallery.com/). The NFT series and WAX were [covered in the mainstream media](https://www.lapresse.ca/arts/arts-visuels/2021-09-16/galerie-jano-lapin/anne-jano-bienfaitrice-des-arts.php) in a cross-promotional effort.

### Ocean Defenders
Our cooperation with the Ocean Defenders is going into the next phase. After the project was publicly announced at an event at the beginning of August, we’ve distributed Founder’s Packs to all early supporters of the projects via NFT claim links, a powerful tool that showcases once again the efficiency of WAX NFTs. We’ve created the [Ocean.gems account and collection](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/ocean.gems) and are in the process of getting verified by AtomicHub. 

While the Ocean Defenders NFT assets are in the final stages of production, we are also finalizing plans for a campaign on the [Ocean Defenders Instagram Channel](https://www.instagram.com/theoceandefenders/). The goal of the campaign is to onboard new users to the WAX Ecosystem before the Ocean Defenders NFT sale goes live.

The VR Graffiti Battles were chosen to receive a [$PAGE grant](https://medium.com/work-in-progress-publishing/wipp-monthly-august-2021-55f4354c48c2) by WIP Publishing and invited to join the PAGE DAO, along with other familiar names such as The Cryptowriter, Cipher.media, LADz City, and the Tokensmart Community.

The VRGB team is very happy to be part of such a diverse group and proud to represent the WAX ecosystem to the wider crypto space in a collaborative spirit.
