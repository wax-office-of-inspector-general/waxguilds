## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Rate limiting disclosure: EOS Nation has a variety of techniques to prevent "abuse" of our public APIs with the goal of making them available for the most users as possible. 

We offer paid plans with very generous rate limits for dApps that need it.

For public users limiting is primary done based on IP address with read limits of up to 75 requests/second, depending on API. Push transaction requests are the most severely rate limited at approximately 5 requests/second. Rate limits are set to allow bursting for short time periods. IP addresses are banned for a few minutes for the first time abuse is detected.  Ban time is doubled each subsequent time.

To avoid getting banned, API callers should stop sending requests when an HTTP 429 "too many requests" response is received.
