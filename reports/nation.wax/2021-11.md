### WAX Detective
[waxdetective.io](https://waxdetective.io/network)

**Usage:** [WAX Detective had 2.2K users](https://imgur.com/a/pcUiZD1), 4.2K sessions, and an average session duration of 3m 18s over the last 28 days. It's been more popular than EOS Detective, which has had 652 users and an average session duration of 1m 10s over the same time period.

**Development Updates:** We've increased our datacenter capacity to support a higher volume of queries and faster results. WAX Detective queries are resource intensive, so we've added additional hardware to support demand as we scale.

**Roadmap:** We have recently assigned more development resources to EOS/WAX Detective as it is a core component of Pomelo's sybil detection technology. We're working on making queries more efficient (faster and less resource intensive), more advanced, with more rich results. In the future we will also add support for tracking additional assets, such as NFTs. 

### BP Validator and blockchain stats

**Usage/Development Updates/Roadmap:** The OIG and WAX Guild community are our primary audience for this product. We did not make any changes this month but are always receptive to requests from the OIG and WAX community to improve the utility of these foundational tools.

**Development Updates/Roadmap:** Still in prototype phase, we continue to make progress towards our goal of making it easy to create custom drop experiences for artists and projects releasing NFT collections on WAX. We hired a new front-end developer in November and now have 2 working on building general purpose and modular components for NFT drops and blends. These are building blocks that will make it quick and easy to create beautiful custom drop and blend pages for creators releasing collections with AttomicAssets.

### Pomelo Grants for Public Goods on EOSIO

[Pomelo.io](https://pomelo.io/grants)

Developed by EOS Nation and EOS Asia, [Pomelo is a crowdfunding platform for Public Goods on EOSIO](https://feather-nutmeg-4f2.notion.site/Pomelo-Grants-Policy-Wiki-75af621b2e1a4012b970b38719ba6c37) that multiplies contributions with the magic of quadratic funding. Any public goods that benefit the EOSIO Ecosystem are eligible to participate in Pomelo grants and we've had a number of WAX projects already participate in Season 1 who have been successful in receiving community donations and a share of the $500K matching pool provided by the EOS Network Foundation.

With 1 day still remaining in the Season 1 donation period, we've already [raised ~122K USD](https://imgur.com/a/ylm4P2E) for 76 grants from 985 contributors. Aside from donations, projects that have been listed on Pomelo are getting great exposure, with more than [23K users visiting](https://imgur.com/a/f2rc1tF) in the past 28 days. Since all projects funded on Pomelo must be public goods, they serve as open source building blocks that benefit the entire EOSIO Ecosystem. 

### provinz.digital
Our partnership with provinz.digital allows us to combine scientifically sound market insights into contemporary art with our expertise in the field of blockchain/NFT technology, thus creating a sustainable, transparent and democratic marketplace on WAX for digital art with increasing potential for artists and collectors around the globe. 

As our first release, we are presenting digital artworks by [Erik Schmidt](https://wax.atomichub.io/drops/85341+85342+85343) and [Florian Adolph](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=fadolph.pd). Both artists and their NFTs on the WAX network were presented at the [ART COLOGNE](https://www.artcologne.com/), the oldest art fair in the world, and one of the most important industry meeting points for galleries and art institutions in Germany. It has been an occasion for generations of art collectors to discover, collect, exchange ideas and establish new contacts. For us, this was the perfect place to introduce the new medium of NFTs on WAX to the traditional art world.

### sk8coin
.gems are proud to officially announce a partnership with[ sk8coin.io](http://sk8coin.io/) and welcome Sk8coin mastermind Jason aka [Lovehandlz](https://twitter.com/TheLoveHandlz) to the .gems family.

Jason has been a real OG in the NFT space pushing decentralized concepts on the [cent platform](https://beta.cent.co/LoveHandlz/) since early 2020.

He's also a pioneer in bringing skateboarding to the blockchain and created exciting NFT blending games on WAX via [Neftyblocks](https://neftyblocks.com/c/skatecoinwax/marketplace?sort=created&order=desc&collection_name=skatecoinwax).

A perfect match for street.gems! 

Additionally, the .gems team is going to sign [Jahzeal Bell](https://instagram.com/jahzeal_/) as their rider for the year 2022, piloting Sk8coin's innovative concept of decentralized sponsorships for skateboarding artists.

Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGfONY3f-ak) to get an idea of his style and the NTFs that we are going to produce with this amazing young skateboarding talent.

There are an estimated 15 Million active Skateboarders worldwide and we're excited to introduce yet another pillar of street culture to the world of WAX NFTs.
