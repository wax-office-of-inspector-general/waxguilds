**Development Updates:** We've improved the efficiency of our query method, making investigating transactions with WAX Detective more responsive and capable of handling more data per query.

**Roadmap:** We're continuing to make queries more efficient (faster and less resource intensive), more advanced, with more rich results. In the future we will also add support for tracking additional assets, such as NFTs.

**Usage/Development Updates/Roadmap:** The OIG and WAX Guild community are our primary audience for this product. We did not make any changes this month but are always receptive to requests from the OIG and WAX community to improve the utility of these foundational tools. 

### .gems NFT distribution toolkit

**Prototypes:**
[dotgems.io](https://dotgems.io)
[blend.dotgems.io](https://blend.dotgems.io/wax)

**Development Updates:** We've made great progress on our React Component Library for AttomicAssets drops. Based on the learnings building the dotgems.io marketplace and blend.dogems.io, these building blocks will make it quick and easy for creators leveraging AttomicAssets to create beautiful custom drop and blend pages. The React Component Library is now 75% complete.

This month we worked on big components such as the drop details, drop banner, updated the drop card, worked on the NFT display and a few others.

We worked on the welcome page, which will help guide developers that are going to use the library on how to install it and use it.

We've added various controls that controls to the avatar (profile icon) such as size (sm, md, lg), variants (elegant, dynamic), data (image, name label) and also the config of what happens when  you click the avatar.

The NFT display is new and now allows data to be passed such as img, backimg, cardimg or video sourced from IPFS addresses. The NFT display config now allows you to customize the default display and the loop config will allow you to scroll through the various images or videos.  In terms of video options, we've added the autoplay config and the  showselector config. Showselector allows you to remove the option of users seeing and selecting the various img/backimg/video options and instead just being show the programmed loop. The 4 final new controls, which include size, variant, className and style, are not yet implemented but will be by the next update.

QtyControl allows you to control the amount of NFTs that a user can purchase per transaction and includes configs such as maxQty (implemented) and a few configs that still need to be implemented (isEditable, onChange, isRounded)

The Tag config features different styles, sizes, and data that allows you to pass an icon and/or some text.

In terms of Collection configs, we've made some small adjustments to the text display.

Everything in the Drop config is new including DropBanner (not yet implemented), DropCard (implemented), DropDetails (implemented).

In DropDetails we have implement all of the data (drop_id, collection_name, assets_to_mint, listing_price, settlement_symbol, price_recipient, fee_rate, auth_required, account_limit, account_limit_cooldown, max_claimable, current_claimed, start_time, end_time, display_data, collection, template)  as well as some configs options (showArtist, showCollection, showAbout, showBurnableTransferable, showViewData).

We've also implemented the wallet component which now allows users to login with Anchor and Wombat. WCW implementation will be ready before the next OIG report.

A video demo of our components has been emailed to the OIG team. 

**Roadmap:** This month we'll be prototyping a drop leveraging these new components and working towards making the library public and open source for anyone to use for their own drops. We'll also port the React Components to Vue.js.

Introducing our interactive digital  NFT magazine powered by flipbook technology and the WAX blockchain network. This NFT based digital magazine features all of the skaters from our alpha series along with new skaters from around the world.

The sk8coin NFT magazine contains claimable links to free NFT drops exclusively available only to magazine holders and gives collectors an entirely new interactive experience while getting to know the skaters they support. Additional features include embedded videos, interactive links, and interviews with skaters and filmers from all parts of the globe that produce the magical content, as well as articles relating to the work it takes to make it all happen.

Collectors can get a glimpse of what it’s like to be in the field directly from the skateboarder’s point of view. We also offer advertisement opportunities for projects looking to get exposure to the community that follows our project. If you enjoy skateboarding culture and NFT games you will absolutely love our new magazine which also includes reviews on the newest and hottest projects on WAX.

The magazine will initially be available on WAX and will expand to other blockchains soon. New issues will be released bi-monthly with each issue featuring interviews with the skaters, film crews, and influencers involved with the project as well as exclusive NFTs only found in these digital magazines. The NFT sets claimed will be fully upgradeable to 5 different levels using our blend fusion technology on Nefty Blocks.

In January, collectors will be able to mint the sk8coin Magazine by [blending all the rare skateboards](https://neftyblocks.com/c/skatecoinwax/blends/super) from the [Virtual Reality Graffiti Battle Season 00 collection](https://wax.atomichub.io/drops/79834+79835).
