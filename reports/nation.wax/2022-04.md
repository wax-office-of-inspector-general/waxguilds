### Code / Documentation

#### API & Debugging

You can now lookup recent failed transactions here: <http://wax.api.eosnation.io/transaction_lookup> 

For best results, provide an account name or transaction id. If a failed transaction reaches Nation, you will see it here. It may be listed multiple times if there are different types of failures and for each server where it is seen. Happy debugging!

### .gems Discovery Stream

The [.gems Discovery stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dotgems) is highlighting the most recent and upcoming WAX NFT projects on a regular basis.
