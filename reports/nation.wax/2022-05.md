### WAX Detective

[waxdetective.io](https://waxdetective.io/network)

Usage April 16-May 30:

-   1.5K users

-   3.6K sessions

-   4m 46s average session duration

-   [WAX Detective Google Analytics](https://github.com/EOS-Nation/waxguilds/blob/main/reports/nation.wax/files/Analytics%20All%20Web%20Site%20Data%20Audience%20Overview%2020220416-20220530.pdf)

Development Updates:

-   We're continuing to explore a rebuild of WAX Detective that leverages [Firehose Substreams](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams) powered by [our own dfuse Firehose](https://github.com/EOS-Nation/firehose). This would improve the robustness of Detective and serve as a strong foundation to begin adding new features like NFT tracking. This will take months of research and development and will likely not result in any noticeable changes in the short term.

### Monitoring/Troubleshooting

On May 20 we noticed that several nodes, including block producer node were using more CPU than typical. Experience tells us that when unexpected things happen, an urgent investigation is required in case there is some new exploit for which a mitigation is required.

Several things were investigated and after discussing with Kevin Heifner on May 21, [a bug issue was created](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/mandel/issues/296).

This issue was quickly fixed on nodeos 2.0 and a new nodeos 2.0.14 was released by EOS Network Foundation. Stan (cc32d9) quickly integrated the change into WAX nodeos and was available for BPs to deploy. The change is also included in [upcoming mandel 3.1 release](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/mandel/releases/tag/v2.0.14), which we've been testing on the Jungle4 testnet.

At the end of this, the change did not reduce the CPU usage on nodeos itself, but mitigated a potential attack vector on the network.  CPU has since returned to normal historical levels.

### Code/Documentation

#### API & Debugging

We've made some minor improvements to our [transaction lookup tool](http://wax.api.eosnation.io/transaction_lookup).

We've requested [improvements to logging of meta data in EOSIO](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/mandel/issues/91), which has been prioritized for development for Mandel 3.1.

### .gems Discovery Stream

The [.gems Discovery stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dotgems) is highlighting the most recent and upcoming WAX NFT projects on a regular basis. Because streams on Twitch are only available for 2 weeks, we port previous episodes of the [.gems Discovery stream to Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwV0OcnQsvXbXBEVLIaX05sDcrsAU335I) for our community to rewatch.
