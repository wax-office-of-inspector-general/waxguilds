### Troubleshooting WAX network issues with block producers
Matthew Darwin has been actively involved in troubleshooting the network-wide issue that [began on the morning of August 28th](https://t.me/c/1419410445/5369). Having been part of the team that came up with the block producer configuration required to handle this type of traffic on EOS, Matthew has been able to [recommend changes to other WAX block producers](https://t.me/c/1419410445/6470) that have helped the situation. He is now [working with Kevin Heifner to review the logs](https://t.me/c/1419410445/6466) and further help troubleshoot the issue.

Following a request from some WAX block producers, we've also started working on writing an article detailing how to deploy resilient block producer architecture on Antelope.

### Stress Testing on Leap 3.1

We have been testing leap 3.1 and have found some issues which are being fixed, we are deploying updates and moving to testing leap 3.2 as well as reaching out to developers with documentation providing feedback and opening Github issues.

Since the beginning of February, the content of these WAX Discovery streams has also been translated to Chinese and published in written form to EOS Nation's official WeChat Channel. Here are the new reports, now named according to the WAX Discovery episode number:

-   [Chinese WAX Discovery #24](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/4VJvxMVbPk1aq3UWTXZ0lg) (July 31)

-   [Chinese WAX Discovery #25](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/4VJvxMVbPk1aq3UWTXZ0lg) (July 31)

-   [Chinese WAX Discovery #26](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/4VJvxMVbPk1aq3UWTXZ0lg) (Aug 08)

-   [Chinese WAX Discovery #27](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/4VJvxMVbPk1aq3UWTXZ0lg) (Aug 28)

Moving forward, in order to better promote NFT releases in China we've updated our strategy and created a [dedicated Weibo account,](https://weibo.com/u/7755853538) which allows us to target a following that is specifically interested in NFTs. Instead of publishing weekly articles our goal is to post more frequently, while each post is focussing on an upcoming drop.

We believe that this new strategy will increase engagement and bring more attention to WAX in the young Chinese NFT community.

WAX Discovery articles are also translated and published in Korean and we recently started a [Korean WAX Discovery Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/waxnftskorean/?hl=en). Here are the new reports, now named according to the WAX Discovery episode number:

-   [Korean WAX Discovery #24 (July 22)](https://m.post.naver.com/viewer/postView.naver?volumeNo=34176918&memberNo=57767944)

### sk8coin

Updates:

-   [sk8coin Metazine issue #4](https://www.sk8coin.io/metazine) was minted and released on August 30th 18:00 UTC on[ NeftyBlocks](https://neftyblocks.com/c/skatecoinwax). sk8coin Metazine is free to read and contains links to the NFTs featured inside that can be claimed once you have purchased the Cover NFT on NeftyBlocks. Issue #4 will feature an exclusive interview with skater[  ](https://www.instagram.com/zeal.1_/)Brandon Decoud, as well as NFTs from his bag of tricks inside the Metazine. The publication will also feature advertisements and reviews of various WAX projects.

-   WAX WHEELS -  We have started collaborating with multiple artists on WAX by dropping cross-branded skateboard wheel NFTs on NeftyBlocks. These wheels will be able to be blended together with other skateboard components to build a complete rare skateboard NFT. So far we've collaborated with 3 artists: [Broken Dollz](https://twitter.com/DollzBroken) dropped [8/2/22](https://neftyblocks.com/c/skatecoinwax/drops/129814), [Esthetic Monte](https://twitter.com/Esthetic_Monte) dropped [8/9/22 ](https://neftyblocks.com/c/skatecoinwax/drops/130931)and [Santino Ramos](https://twitter.com/SantinoRamos) dropped on [8/16/22 ](https://neftyblocks.com/c/skatecoinwax/drops/131724)as well as a [NeftyBlocks](https://twitter.com/neftyblocks) wheel dropped [8/16/22](https://neftyblocks.com/c/skatecoinwax/drops/132740). More collaborations are planned including a cross chain collaboration with the [FlyFrogs](https://twitter.com/FlyFrogsNFT) collection on Ethereum.

-   A new feature has been added to sk8coin in which a user can send sk8coin NFTs from any WAX wallet to the smart contract [skatenftswap](https://wax.bloks.io/account/skatenftswap) and automatically be sent back fungible SKATE tokens.

The NFT templates and values are listed below.

Template ID [#120614](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/template/skatecoinwax/120614) =  1 (SKATE) FT

Template ID [#120626 ](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/template/skatecoinwax/120626)= 10 (SKATE) FTs 

Template ID [#120638 ](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/template/skatecoinwax/120638) = 25 (SKATE) FTs  

Template ID [#176507](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/template/skatecoinwax/176507) = 100 (SKATE) FTs

Template ID [ #225741](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/template/skatecoinwax/225741) = 1000 (SKATE) FTs

The purpose of (SKATE) FTs is a loyalty/reward point program. Users will be able to spend SKATE tokens to purchase sk8coin NFTs and VIRL products on [www.sk8coin.io](https://www.sk8coin.io/). 

-   Staking has been implemented for sk8coin [skatecoinmag](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/schema/skatecoinwax/skatecoinmag), [Wheels](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/schema/skatecoinwax/wheelstecoinwax/crypto.clips) and[ Food.Token ](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/schema/skatecoinwax/food.tokens)schemas on <https://waxdao.io/farms>. Collectors can now claim (SKATE) as rewards for donating to our last [food drive](https://twitter.com/NFTland/status/1370132147584008199) which can be exchanged for $WAXP on [Alcor Dex. ](https://alcor.exchange/swap?output=WAX-eosio.token&input=SKATE-skatecoinwax)

### The Ocean Defenders

Initiated by a committed group of artists, scientists and watersport professionals, the Ocean Defenders Trading Cards series aims to raise awareness about marine conservation, cooperate with sustainable businesses, and educate in a fun way.

The Ocean Defenders Project continues their operations and builds their community.

The WAX based project was presented at the [Burning Man Festival Playa](https://playaevents.burningman.org/) events and is preparing an exhibit on [Bit Basel](https://bitbasel.com/) in Miami on Nov 29th later this year.

After the initial onboarding phase the 2nd wave of Ocean Defenders will go up for sale on [NeftyBlocks](https://neftyblocks.com/c/ocean.gems).
