Development Updates:

We've adapted [StreamingFast](https://www.streamingfast.io/)'s Ethereum [Firehose for Antelope](https://github.com/EOS-Nation/firehose-antelope), which is the base layer of the new data stack that will power the next generation of WAX Detective. The second layer of this data stack will be [Substreams](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/). This modular data stack is much more scalable and robust than the stack that currently powers WAX Detective, and is the same stack that powers [The Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com/en/), the industry standard for Web3 data indexing.  

Antelope Failed Transaction Lookup tool (Spyglass)
--------------------------------------------------

EOS Nation has released the prototype of our [failed transaction lookup tool for WAX](https://wax.api.eosnation.io/transaction_lookup) and other Antelope chains. The team is actively developing the first full release of this new product, which will be called Spyglass.

### Objective

[Spyglass](http://eos.api.eosnation.io/transaction_lookup) tracks successful and failed decentralized network transactions to provide insight on the blockchain's behaviors and operators.

### What we do

We help WAX users understand how and who executes their blockchain transactions. We work with operators to build tools improving insight and accountability to decentralized networks. We concise big data into showing us valuable trends to identify problems or bottlenecks within nodes and operators.

### Why we do it

Failed transactions are often impossible to track for the users as they don't appear in the blockchain. An additional data layer is a must. Web3 is built on transparency and trust, blockchain users must have the resources to understand what is going on at every level. Decentralized networks are only as reliable as their operators. Providing insight on their performance is crucial to the evolution of Web3.

.gems Discovery Stream
----------------------

Our weekly .gems WAX Discovery Shows feature non-sponsored reviews of on-going WAX NFT releases, allowing us to offer our honest opinions about these projects and highlight the ones we think will bring most value to the WAX community.

Additionally, we're also translating and sharing all of the details of these WAX projects in our weekly Chinese and Korean publications. In order to better target the Asian NFT community, we've created 3 new dedicated WAX Discovery Show social media accounts. For our Chinese community, we've created a [Weibo](https://weibo.com/u/7755853538) account and for our Korean community we've created both a [Naver](https://m.post.naver.com/my.naver?memberNo=57767944) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/waxnftskorean/?hl=en) account.

Below is the list of all our new publications and featured projects since the last WAX OIG report:

Chinese [Weibo](https://m.weibo.cn/u/7755853538) Publications

In order to increase the effectiveness of our marketing for WAX NFT releases in China we've created a dedicated Weibo account which allows us to target followers that are specifically interested in NFTs. Instead of publishing weekly articles, our goal is to post more frequently with each post focussing on one upcoming drop. We believe that this new modus will increase engagement and bring more attention to WAX in the young Chinese NFT community.
