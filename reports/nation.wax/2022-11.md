### Development Updates:

We've continued work on adapting [StreamingFast](https://www.streamingfast.io/)'s Ethereum [Substreams](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/) for Antelope chains, which will power the next generation of WAX Detective.    

Spyglass
--------

EOS Nation has almost completed development on [Spyglass](https://spyglass.network/), based on the prototype of our [failed transaction lookup tool for WAX](https://wax.api.eosnation.io/transaction_lookup) and other Antelope chains. The site is already live, but it's still a work in progress and not fully functional. We expect it to be feature complete with full support for the WAX network in the coming weeks.

-   [Blockchain.stats.eosnation.io](https://blockchain.stats.eosnation.io/)

### Development Updates:

Some new features in Leap 3.2 that we contributed to (see our ecosystem development updates) improved logging details such that we could enhance the metrics collection and display process as seen by new charts we've added to [blockchain.stats.eosnation.io](https://blockchain.stats.eosnation.io/).

New charts added: 

-   CPU /round

-   NET /round 

-   Elapsed time /round

-   Idle/Available time /block

-   Successful/Failed Other time /block

-   Successful/Failed transaction count

## Pomelo

[Pomelo](https://pomelo.io/) is a [crowdfunding platform supporting the development of public goods](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/what-is-pomelo-feb059bfd531) for the Antelope ecosystem that leverages [quadratic funding](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/the-magic-of-quadratic-funding-89b9649a6b3a) to amplify the impact of donations according to the wisdom of the crowd. While EOS is currently the only supported payment method, it is open to all projects that benefit the wider Antelope ecosystem. Many WAX projects have participated over the past year and received funding to continue building their critical public goods. In the future, we intend to accept WAX as a payment method for donors and hope to even have WAX-specific matching pools (assuming we can attract WAX matching partners). Since grants need to be public goods to qualify for funding, many of them are open source building blocks that benefit the entire Antelope ecosystem, even if they were originally intended for a specific chain like EOS or Telos. This season we launched [a new feature called collections](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/what-are-collections-75757e25234b) that enable community members to curate their favorite projects. Our .gems team has crafted a [WAX Discovery collection](https://pomelo.io/collections/waxdiscovery) to highlight the WAX projects participating this season (see our ecosystem development updates for more on that).

Over the previous 3 seasons, we've raised more than $2.2M for public goods that benefit the Antelope ecosystem. [Season 4 is now underway](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/pomelo-season-4-what-you-need-to-know-270196358c17). 

## Open Source Smart Contracts 

We offer the WAX community access to our smart contracts to use in their projects, such as our [gems.blend contract](https://github.com/dotGems/gems.blend) which is currently used for all blends in the Wombat Dungeon Master application.

Troubleshooting and Testing
---------------------------

We did extensive testing on Leap during the 3.2 development cycle. This lead to finding several issues, which were fixed by development before the final release. Additionally, there were lots of discussions with the development team on these and other issues.

### Testing

The list of reported issues by us that were resolved in the 3.2 development cycle:

<https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/86> 

Insufficient input validation on set_whitelist_blacklist, add_greylist_accounts, remove_greylist_accounts

<https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/87> 

"params" object is not required for set_whitelist_blacklist, add_greylist_accounts, remove_greylist_accounts

<https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/109> 

Allow inspection of various queues within nodeos

<https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/119> 

Add more logging of subjective information on non-producing nodes

<https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/130> 

Pinned build: relative directories don't work 

<https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/131> 

Pinned build: aborted download on previous build attempt causes current build to fail

<https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/132> 

Pinned build: instructions are not complete

<https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/312> 

Inconsistency between "Received block" and "Produced block" messages

<https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/324> 

3.2.0-rc1 doesn't handle API not found errors correctly

<https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/346> 

${remaining} blocks remaining message is not clear

<https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/411> 

nodeos 3.2.0-rc1 doesn't shut down when SHIP is enabled

Several of the issues resolved in leap 3.2 improved logging details such that we could enhance the metrics collection and display process as seen by new charts added to blockchain.stats.eosnation.io (See product updates above for more details)

We've already upgraded all (relevant) nodes to leap 3.2 as an early adopter.

### Debugging/troubleshooting

Debugging during issues on the network, as seen on November 28. This includes both live troubleshooting as well as followup analysis and debugging and testing working in conjunction with the leap development team.  As of November 30, work is still ongoing to review the latest issues.


Antelope Node Operator Round Table
----------------------------------

We host and lead the newly rebranded Antelope Node Operator Round Table, attended by some of the most technical block producers from the Antelope ecosystem, such at EOSphere, EOS USA, and EOS Nation, along with members of the Antelope development team from ENF and OCI, and dedicated members of the community. What began as a weekly call in February 2022 to prepare for the Antelope Leap upgrade on the EOS Network, has now evolved into a weekly roundtable discussion between node operators and the core developers to discuss and share feedback on how to improve the Antelope protocol.

You can find recordings and summaries of all of the meetings in the public github repository shared below (note, the Antelope round table begins after the successful Leap Upgrade beginning on October 26.

<https://github.com/orgs/EOS-Nation/projects/3> 

WAX Discovery Show 
-------------------

Our weekly live [WAX Discovery Show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwV0OcnQsvXbXBEVLIaX05sDcrsAU335I) features reviews on current WAX NFT releases. All these shows are non-sponsored content. 

In the time since the last WAX OIG Report, we have featured the collections listed below.

Additionally, we share detailed information about each drop with our Korean and Chinese communities. For the translated content we have created a dedicated WAX Discovery social media account.

Here are some social media stats for the WAX Discovery Shows and our .gems Twitter account which is used to promote the WAX Discovery Shows and related giveaways:

### Chinese WAX Discovery Translation Links

For marketing WAX-based NFT releases in China we have updated our strategy and created a dedicated Weibo account, which allows us to target followers specifically interested in NFTs. Instead of publishing weekly articles, our goal is to post more frequently, while each post focuses on an upcoming drop.

We believe that this new modus will increase engagement and bring more attention to WAX in the young Chinese NFT community.

For Chinese WAX Discovery Shows #37 to #42, we accumulated [978 views.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kZrZctyafqGFnoYabYgKsoQwZdHhIUvH/view?usp=share_link)

### WAX Discovery Collection on Pomelo - Curated for WAX community  

Pomelo season 4 has kicked off and is open to all community members from the Antelope ecosystem including the WAX community. A new feature is the Collections, an opportunity to bundle various grants together and promote them.

The WAX Discovery team has reviewed approved Pomelo grants and has curated a list of grant applications created by builders that are active in the WAX Community. The goal is to highlight the contributions that the WAX community is bringing to the greater Antelope ecosystem.

As new applications are going to be approved the list continues to grow. Check it out: <https://pomelo.io/collections/waxdiscovery>
