### Development Updates:

We've continued work on adapting [StreamingFast](https://www.streamingfast.io/)'s Ethereum [Substreams](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/) for Antelope chains, which will power the next generation of WAX Detective.    

Spyglass
--------

EOS Nation has almost completed development on [Spyglass](https://spyglass.network/), based on the prototype of our [failed transaction lookup tool for WAX](https://wax.api.eosnation.io/transaction_lookup) and other Antelope chains. The site is already live, but it's still a work in progress and not fully functional. We expect it to be feature complete with full support for the WAX network in the coming weeks.

Pomelo
------

[Pomelo](https://pomelo.io/) is a [crowdfunding platform supporting the development of public goods](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/what-is-pomelo-feb059bfd531) for the Antelope ecosystem that leverages [quadratic funding](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/the-magic-of-quadratic-funding-89b9649a6b3a) to amplify the impact of donations according to the wisdom of the crowd. While EOS is currently the only supported payment method, it is open to all projects that benefit the wider Antelope ecosystem. Many WAX projects have participated over the past year and received funding to continue building their critical public goods. In the future, we intend to accept WAX as a payment method for donors and hope to even have WAX-specific matching pools (assuming we can attract WAX matching partners). Since grants need to be public goods to qualify for funding, many of them are open source building blocks that benefit the entire Antelope ecosystem, even if they were originally intended for a specific chain like EOS or Telos. In season 4 we launched [a new feature called collections](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/what-are-collections-75757e25234b) that enable community members to curate their favorite projects. Our .gems team crafted a [WAX Discovery collection](https://pomelo.io/collections/waxdiscovery) to highlight the WAX projects participating this season (see our ecosystem development updates for more on that).

### Pomelo Season 4 ran from November 14 - December 14

-   Approved Grants: 138

-   Matching Pool value: $365,000

-   Donations Raised: ~$93,812

-   Average Donation: $17.76

-   Median Donation: $0.84

-   Contributions: 5281

-   Unique Contributors: 907

Over the previous 4 seasons, we've raised more than $2.65M for public goods that benefit WAX and the Antelope ecosystem. Season 5 will take place in Q1 2023.

Open Source Smart Contracts 
----------------------------

We offer the WAX community access to our smart contracts to use in their projects, such as our [gems.blend contract](https://github.com/dotGems/gems.blend) which is currently used for all blends in the Wombat Dungeon Master application.

Troubleshooting and Testing
------------------------------

Ongoing testing of new code (for future nodeos releases) and discussions with core Dev team on issues seen on the network.

[3.2 state_history_plugin crashes under heavy load](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/592)

-   A community member reported the problem in Telegram, and Matthew Darwin (EOS Nation) coordinated with the Antelope development team to get it fixed.

[Syncing sometimes stops on sync wait timeout](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/605)

-   Matthew reported to Kevin who created the issue\
[3.2: when ship node exits with error it usually doesn't start up again properly with snapshot](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/596)

Upgraded all (relevant) nodes to leap 3.2.

Antelope Node Operator Round Table - hosted by EOS Nation
------------------------------------------------------------

The congestion issues on WAX were a topic of great discussion recently during recent round tables.

The Antelope Node Operator Round Table is a weekly roundtable discussion between node operators and core developers to discuss and share feedback on how to improve the Antelope protocol. It's attended by some of the most technical block producers from the WAX ecosystem, such at EOSphere, EOS USA, and EOS Nation, along with members of the Antelope development team from ENF and OCI, and dedicated members of the Antelope community.

WAX Discovery Show 
----------------------

Our weekly live [WAX Discovery Show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwV0OcnQsvXbXBEVLIaX05sDcrsAU335I) features reviews on current WAX NFT releases. All these shows are non-sponsored content. Starting with this OIG Report, the WAX Discovery Show will be listed under "Products" instead of "Ecosystem Developments" as we feel it is better suited in this category.

In the time since the last WAX OIG Report, we have featured the collections listed below.

Additionally, we share detailed information about each drop with our Korean and Chinese communities. For the translated content we have created a dedicated WAX Discovery social media account.

Here are some social media stats for the WAX Discovery Shows and our .gems Twitter account which is used to promote the WAX Discovery Shows and related giveaways:

### Chinese WAX Discovery Translation Links

For marketing WAX-based NFT releases in China we have updated our strategy and created a dedicated Weibo account, which allows us to target followers specifically interested in NFTs. Instead of publishing weekly articles, our goal is to post more frequently, while each post focuses on an upcoming drop.

We believe that this new modus will increase engagement and bring more attention to WAX in the young Chinese NFT community.

For Chinese WAX Discovery Shows #44 to #47, we accumulated [2550 views (+260%).](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kZrZctyafqGFnoYabYgKsoQwZdHhIUvH/view?usp=share_link)

### WAX Discovery Collection on Pomelo - Curated for WAX community  

Pomelo season 4 helped raise funding for all community members from the Antelope ecosystem including the WAX community.

The WAX Discovery team has reviewed and approved Pomelo grants and has curated a list of grant applications created by builders that are active in the WAX Community. The goal is to highlight the contributions that the WAX community is bringing to the greater Antelope ecosystem.

We'll make sure that all WAX projects that get approved as Pomelo grants get added to this WAX Discover collection. So far, 11 grant recipients from the WAX community have been awarded donations through this collection and other donors on Pomelo.
