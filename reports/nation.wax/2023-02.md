### Development Updates:

We've made much progress on our [Substreams for Antelope](https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams-antelope), which will power the next generation of WAX Detective. Note: Substreams for Antelope lives in our Pinax GitHub organization. Pinax is a new venture operated by the same team behind EOS Nation, focused on developing and operating blockchain agnostic Web3 data services compatible with [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/).

Spyglass
--------

EOS Nation has almost completed development on [Spyglass](https://spyglass.network/), based on the prototype of our [failed transaction lookup tool for WAX](https://wax.api.eosnation.io/transaction_lookup) and other Antelope chains. Based on feedback from recent events, we have incorporated the "contract" and "action" field into our back-end. The fields can already be viewed in our prototype failed transaction lookup tool, and for an early preview of the Spyglass interface, feel free to visit [https://spyglass.network/inspect/wax](https://dev.spyglass.network/inspect/wax). While this site is already live, it's still a work in progress, and some features are not displaying live data. We expect Spyglass to be feature complete with full support for the WAX network in the coming weeks.Â

Pomelo
------

[Pomelo](https://pomelo.io/) is a [crowdfunding platform supporting the development of public goods](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/what-is-pomelo-feb059bfd531) for the Antelope ecosystem that leverages [quadratic funding](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/the-magic-of-quadratic-funding-89b9649a6b3a) to amplify the impact of donations according to the wisdom of the crowd. While EOS is currently the only supported payment method, it is open to all projects that benefit the wider Antelope ecosystem. Many WAX projects have participated over the past year and received funding to continue building their critical public goods. In the future, we intend to accept WAX as a payment method for donors and hope to even have WAX-specific matching pools (assuming we can attract WAX matching partners). Since grants need to be public goods to qualify for funding, many of them are open source building blocks that benefit the entire Antelope ecosystem, even if they were originally intended for a specific chain like EOS or Telos. In season 4 we launched [a new feature called collections](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/what-are-collections-75757e25234b) that enable community members to curate their favorite projects. Our .gems engagement team crafted a [WAX Discovery Collection](https://pomelo.io/collections/waxdiscovery) to highlight and promote the WAX projects participating in Pomelo. (see our ecosystem development updates for more on that).

### Pomelo Season 4 ran from November 14 - December 14

-   Approved Grants: 138

-   Matching Pool value: $365,000

-   Donations Raised: ~$93,812

-   Average Donation: $17.76

-   Median Donation: $0.84

-   Contributions: 5281

-   Unique Contributors: 907

Over the previous 4 seasons, we've raised more than $2.65M for public goods that benefit WAX and the Antelope ecosystem. [Season 5](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/announcing-pomelo-season-5-applications-open-feb-22-6dc1b934deff) is now live. [Grant applications opened](https://twitter.com/PomeloGrants/status/1628124104908804123) on February 22nd and donations open on March 1st.

Open Source Smart ContractsÂ 
----------------------------

We offer the WAX community access to our smart contracts to use in their projects, such as our [gems.blend contract](https://github.com/dotGems/gems.blend) which is currently used for all blends in the Wombat Dungeon Master application.

Troubleshooting and Testing
---------------------------

We continue to play an integral role in creating troubleshooting documents, technical discussion videos, and bug fixes for the Antelope ecosystem.

We update to the latest versions of nodeos in order to find issues before they are experienced by many other WAX Guilds and BPs on other Antelope chains. We will be testing the next Antelope pre-release when it becomes available.

Here is a list of our recent contributions and troubleshooting sessions available to the WAX community on GitHub by [Matthew Darwin](https://github.com/matthewdarwin).

-   GitHub: [http requests fails with timeout on large block (json.hpp issue?) #677](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/677)

-   GitHub: [Make debug http logging do something useful (appears to do nothing) #678](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/678)

-   GitHub: [get_block large timeout exceeded values in 3.2 #679](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/679)

-   GitHub: [Add send_transaction2 to the documentation #689](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/689)

Antelope Node Operator Round Table - hosted by EOS Nation
---------------------------------------------------------

The Antelope Node Operator Round Table is a weekly roundtable discussion between node operators and core developers to discuss and share feedback on how to improve the Antelope protocol. It's attended by some of the most technical block producers from the WAX ecosystem, such at EOSphere, EOS USA, and EOS Nation, along with members of the Antelope development team from ENF and OCI, and dedicated members of the Antelope community.

WAX Discovery ShowÂ 
-------------------

Our weekly live [WAX Discovery Show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwV0OcnQsvXbXBEVLIaX05sDcrsAU335I) features reviews on current WAX NFT releases. All these shows are non-sponsored content. The WAX Discovery Show is now listed under "Products" instead of "Ecosystem Developments" as we feel it is better suited in this category.

In the time since the last WAX OIG Report, we've featured the collections listed below.

Additionally, we share detailed information about each drop with our Korean and Chinese communities. For the translated content we have created a dedicated WAX Discovery social media account.

Here are some social media statistics relating to our WAX Discovery Shows:

### Chinese WAX Discovery Translation Links

For marketing WAX-based NFT releases in China we have updated our strategy and created a dedicated Weibo account, which allows us to target followers specifically interested in NFTs. Instead of publishing weekly articles, our goal is to post more frequently, while each post focuses on an upcoming drop.

We believe that this new modus will increase engagement and bring more attention to WAX in the young Chinese NFT community.

For Chinese WAX Discovery Shows #48 to #52, we accumulated [3879 views (+50%)](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1_t-41UqT3P_k-x5v85xZ6rgHkcC1bL7T)

### WAX Discovery Collection on Pomelo - Curated for WAX communityÂ Â 

Pomelo Season 5 is open to creators for grant applications from all Antelope chains. Pomelo helps raise funding for all community members from the Antelope ecosystem, including the WAX community.

The WAX Discovery team reviews and approves Pomelo grants before including them in our [WAX Discovery Pomelo Collection](https://pomelo.io/collections/waxdiscovery). The goal of this collection is to highlight the builders that are active in the WAX ecosystem and highlight the contributions that the WAX community is bringing to the greater Antelope ecosystem. We want to support these grants and we encourage our community to donate to all of them through our WAX Discovery Pomelo Collection.

Pomelo Season 4 audits are completed and funds are available to be claimed by all successful grants, including for 11 recipients from the WAX community. Here are all of the grants that are included
