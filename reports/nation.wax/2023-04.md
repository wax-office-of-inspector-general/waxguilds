### Development Updates:

We've continued to make progress on our [Substreams for Antelope](https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams-antelope), which will power the next generation of WAX Detective. Note: Substreams for Antelope lives in our Pinax GitHub organization. Pinax is a new venture operated by the same team behind EOS Nation, focused on developing and operating blockchain agnostic Web3 data services compatible with [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/).

Spyglass
--------

EOS Nation has released [Spyglass](https://spyglass.network/), based on the popular [failed transaction lookup tool for WAX](https://wax.api.eosnation.io/transaction_lookup) and other Antelope chains. The tool displays otherwise invisible information about the network, ingesting logs of internal node-to-node messages to track transaction traces. To use the Spyglass interface, visit [https://spyglass.network/inspect/wax](https://dev.spyglass.network/inspect/wax). The network view displays insights into transaction failure rates and error messages, which node operators can use to identify accounts or contracts that are causing throughput issues on the network. Smart contract developers can also use Spyglass to identify specific actions on their contracts that may be consuming excessive resources, and individual users can diagnose transaction propagation issues on their accounts. By displaying all of this hidden information, Spyglass provides important insights into the health of the chain that would otherwise be impossible to collect, particularly when evaluating failed transactions that never make it on-chain.

Pomelo
------

### Background:

[Pomelo](https://pomelo.io/) is a [crowdfunding platform supporting the development of public goods](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/what-is-pomelo-feb059bfd531) for the Antelope ecosystem that leverages [quadratic funding](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/the-magic-of-quadratic-funding-89b9649a6b3a) to amplify the impact of donations according to the wisdom of the crowd. While EOS is currently the only supported payment method, it is open to all projects that benefit the wider Antelope ecosystem. [Many WAX projects have participated](https://pomelo.io/collections/waxdiscovery) over the past year and received funding to continue building their critical public goods. Since grants need to be public goods to qualify for funding, many of them are open source building blocks that benefit the entire Antelope ecosystem, even if they were originally intended for a specific chain like EOS or Telos.

### Development Updates:

The team is preparing for Season 6, which will introduce a brand new multi-pool feature, that will enable matching partners to run their own special-purpose pools funded by a token of their choice with custom grant acceptance criteria. With the launch of Antelope IBC on WAX, that means it will be possible to have a WAX pool on Pomelo specifically for WAX projects, funded by WAX tokens wrapped on EOS. It will also be possible for donors to make donations to their favourite projects using the WAX token. 

### Pomelo Season 5 ran from February 22 - March 23

-   Approved Grants: 127

-   Matching Pool value: $170,730

-   Donations Raised: ~$84,000

-   Average Donation: $18.53

-   Median Donation: $1.83

-   Contributions: 4537

-   Unique Contributors: 609

Over the previous 5 seasons, we've raised more than $3M for public goods that benefit WAX and the Antelope ecosystem.

Open Source Smart Contracts 
----------------------------

We offer the WAX community access to our smart contracts to use in their projects, such as our [gems.blend contract](https://github.com/dotGems/gems.blend) which is currently used for all blends in the Wombat Dungeon Master application.

Troubleshooting and Testing
---------------------------

We continue to play an integral role in creating troubleshooting documents, technical discussion videos, and bug fixes for the Antelope ecosystem.

We update to the latest versions of nodeos in order to find issues before they are experienced by many other WAX Guilds and BPs on other Antelope chains. We will be testing the next Antelope pre-release when it becomes available.

Here is a list of our recent contributions and troubleshooting sessions available to the WAX community on GitHub by [Matthew Darwin](https://github.com/matthewdarwin).

Antelope Node Operator Round Table - hosted by EOS Nation
---------------------------------------------------------

The Antelope Node Operator Round Table is a weekly roundtable discussion between node operators and core developers to discuss and share feedback on how to improve the Antelope protocol. It's attended by some of the most technical block producers from the WAX ecosystem, such at EOSphere, EOS USA, and EOS Nation, along with members of the Antelope development team from ENF and OCI, and dedicated members of the Antelope community.

WAX Discovery Show 
-------------------

Our weekly live [WAX Discovery Show](https://www.youtube.com/@WAXdiscoveryTV) features reviews on current WAX NFT releases. All these shows are non-sponsored content.

Additionally, we share detailed information about each drop with our Korean and Chinese communities. For the translated content we have created a dedicated WAX Discovery social media account.

We have also launched a new dedicated [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@WAXdiscoveryTV) and [Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/WAXdiscoveryTV) for our weekly WAX Discovery TV awareness videos where we feature reviews on current WAX NFT releases and highlight other updates relevant to the development of the WAX ecosystem . All these Videos are non-sponsored content.

Previously the live shows were hosted on the EOS Nation channel, but we're determined and confident to grow an audience that focuses on WAX only.

In addition to the already existing Weibo account we have extended the WAX Discovery presence in China to the popular [XiaoHongShu](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/60f3bf780000000001004da9) platform, which is especially popular among younger generations.

Since the last WAX OIG Report, we have featured the collections listed below.

Here are some social media statistics relating to our WAX Discovery Shows.

### Chinese WAX Discovery Translation Links

For marketing WAX-based NFT releases in China we have updated our strategy and created a dedicated Weibo account, which allows us to target followers specifically interested in NFTs. Instead of publishing weekly articles, our goal is to post more frequently, while each post focuses on an upcoming drop.

We believe that this new modus will increase engagement and bring more attention to WAX in the young Chinese NFT community.

Here are the Chinese WAX Discovery Shows #53 to #59:

### WAX Discovery Collection on Pomelo - Curated for WAX community

Pomelo is open for #Builders from all Antelope chains!

Pomelo helps raise funding for all community members from the Antelope ecosystem, including the WAX community.

In Pomelo Season 5 the WAX Discovery team has reviewed all approved grants and created our curated [WAX Discovery Pomelo Collection](https://pomelo.io/collections/waxdiscovery). This is a list of grant applications by WAX builders that we deem beneficial to the WAX community. The goal is to highlight the contributions that the WAX community is bringing to the greater Antelope ecosystem.

We promoted this funding opportunity on our weekly WAX Discovery Shows to create awareness among the community.

Pomelo Season 5 is now complete and funds will soon be available to be claimed for recipients from the WAX community.
