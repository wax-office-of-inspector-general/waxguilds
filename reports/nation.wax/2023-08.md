WAX Name Service
----------------

[WAX Name Service](https://www.waxnameservice.io) is a marketplace for buying and selling WAX premium names. For example, if you own the premium name "fan" on WAX, you can list it on the marketplace and start selling its sub-names like "wax.fan" or "oig.fan." It's easy to buy a sub-name on the marketplace - just search for a name you'd like and see all of the available sub-names for sale. There are currently [38 names](https://wax.bloks.io/account/names?loadContract=true&tab=Tables&account=names&scope=names&limit=100&table=suffixes&action=buyaccount) listed on the marketplace and names can be purchased using Anchor or Wombat wallets.

[Names can be listed by interacting directly with our smart contract](https://eosnation.io/eos-wax-name-service-guide/). We will be building new features in the UI that make the process of listing and tracking sales of names easier.

All of the [sales and activity for WAX Name Service can be tracked on chain](https://wax.bloks.io/account/names) in any block explorer.

Pomelo
------

### Background:

[Pomelo](https://pomelo.io/) is a [crowdfunding platform supporting the development of public goods](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/what-is-pomelo-feb059bfd531) for the Antelope ecosystem that leverages [quadratic funding](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/the-magic-of-quadratic-funding-89b9649a6b3a) to amplify the impact of donations according to the wisdom of the crowd. While EOS is currently the only supported payment method, it is open to all projects that benefit the wider Antelope ecosystem. [Many WAX projects have participated](https://pomelo.io/collections/waxdiscovery) over the past year and received funding to continue building their critical public goods. Since grants need to be public goods to qualify for funding, many of them are open source building blocks that benefit the entire Antelope ecosystem, even if they were originally intended for a specific chain like EOS or Telos.

### Development Updates:

We've been unable to secure a matching partner for a WAX-specific matching pool in Season 7, but we're wrapping up development on the new [Pomelo Bounties product](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/introducing-pomelo-bounties-186dc4f617e) that will be available on multiple chains including WAX.

Troubleshooting and Testing
---------------------------

We continue to play an integral role in creating troubleshooting documents, technical discussion videos, and bug fixes for the Antelope ecosystem.

We update to the latest versions of nodeos in order to find issues before they are experienced by many other WAX Guilds and BPs on other Antelope chains. We will be testing the next Antelope pre-release when it becomes available.

Here is a list of some of the new contributions and troubleshooting sessions available to the WAX community on GitHub by [Matthew Darwin](https://github.com/matthewdarwin) & [Sajjad Baeidi](https://github.com/sajjadbaeidi).

-   GitHub: [The "bad block exception" logs as an error #1507](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/1507) 

-   GitHub: [When nodeos stops, It doesn't say which file system is exceeded. #1504](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/1504)

-   GitHub: [Add producer name to trx idle log message #1360](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/1360)

-   GitHub: [Add idle data to nodeos 5.0 prometheus exporter #1359](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/1359)

-   GitHub: [Excessive info logs generated by Nodeos causing rapid increase in syslog size #1240](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/1240)

Antelope Node Operator Round Table - hosted by EOS Nation
---------------------------------------------------------

The Antelope Node Operator Round Table is a weekly roundtable discussion between node operators and core developers to discuss and share feedback on how to improve the Antelope protocol. It's attended by some of the most technical block producers from the WAX ecosystem, such at EOSphere, EOS USA, and EOS Nation, along with members of the Antelope development team from ENF and OCI, and dedicated members of the Antelope community.

You can find the video recordings and agenda topics on YouTube:

Bountyblok New Action: Staking Task
-----------------------------------

Bountyblok's new Staking task tracks and rewards users who staked a certain amount of FTs to an account. This feature was developed in collaboration between EOS Nation & Bountyblok. In order to enable Bountyblok to implement this feature, EOS Nation designed and implemented the Webhook system which is powered by Firehose & Substreams infrastructure

Firehose and Substreams endpoints for WAX by Pinax
--------------------------------------------------

The [Pinax Firehose and Substream endpoints](https://pinax.network) for WAX are now available to select partners in our closed beta program and already powering WAX products like Bountyblok's new Staking task. Pinax is operated by the same team behind EOS Nation, focused on developing and operating blockchain agnostic web3 data services compatible with [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/). [Firehose](https://firehose.streamingfast.io/) and [Substreams](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/) are the next generation of history and streaming data technology developed by StreamingFast (the original developers of dfuse) and designed to be more affordable, scalable and reliable than dfuse. [Pinax has ported this technology for Antelope](https://github.com/pinax-network/firehose-antelope) chains and has joined The Graph as core developers and the primary operator of this tech stack. We will be working with chains who are interested in being [integrated with The Graph](https://thegraph.com/blog/chain-integration-process/), including WAX if there is appetite to pursue that from the WAX core team. Regardless of integration with The Graph, our public WAX endpoints will be available soon. We'll be offering free access and premium paid plans.
