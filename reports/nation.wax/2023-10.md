## WAX Name Service
### Background
[WAX Name Service](https://www.waxnameservice.io) is a marketplace for buying and selling WAX premium names. For example, if you own the premium name “fan” on WAX, you can list it on the marketplace and start selling its sub-names like “wax.fan” or “oig.fan.” It’s easy to buy a sub-name on the marketplace - just search for a name you’d like and see all of the available sub-names for sale. There are currently [38 names](https://wax.bloks.io/account/names?loadContract=true&tab=Tables&account=names&scope=names&limit=100&table=suffixes&action=buyaccount) listed on the marketplace and names can be purchased using Anchor or Wombat wallets.

[Names can be listed by interacting directly with our smart contract](https://eosnation.io/eos-wax-name-service-guide/). All of the [sales and activity for WAX Name Service can be tracked on chain](https://wax.bloks.io/account/names) in any block explorer. 

### Usage August 31 - October 12:
2 names sold: 
- banana.moon (21 WAX)
- monkey.boss (25 WAX)
## WAX Detective
### Background
[Waxdetective.io](https://waxdetective.io/network) is a blockchain forensics analysis tool for the WAX blockchain that make it easy to analyze patterns of token transfers between accounts. Members of the WAX community have found the service valuable for identifying wash trading in NFT sales and defending against bot activity attacking their applications.
### Usage August 31 - October 12:
- With Google’s transition to GA4 for analytics, unfortunately we have no usage data available for EOS Detective for this reporting period.
## Spyglass
EOS Nation has continued operating [Spyglass](https://spyglass.network/), alongside our popular [lookup tool for failed transactions on WAX](https://wax.api.eosnation.io/transaction_lookup) and other Antelope chains.

## Pomelo
### Background:
[Pomelo](https://pomelo.io/) is a [crowdfunding platform supporting the development of public goods](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/what-is-pomelo-feb059bfd531) for the Antelope ecosystem that leverages [quadratic funding](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/the-magic-of-quadratic-funding-89b9649a6b3a) to amplify the impact of donations according to the wisdom of the crowd. While EOS is currently the only supported payment method, it is open to all projects that benefit the wider Antelope ecosystem. [Many WAX projects have participated](https://pomelo.io/collections/waxdiscovery) over the past year and received funding to continue building their critical public goods. Since grants need to be public goods to qualify for funding, many of them are open source building blocks that benefit the entire Antelope ecosystem, even if they were originally intended for a specific chain like EOS or Telos. 
### Development Updates:
[Season 7 is in progress with a $150,000 matching pool](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/join-pomelo-season-7-applications-open-sept-20-c9886927c278), and concludes on October 19. While the matching pools are primarily targeted to projects on EOS, many of the teams participating are raising funds for projects that are running on WAX. Since projects need to qualify as public goods to participate, many of them are funding open-source building blocks that are valuable to all Antelope-based blockchains, including WAX. Due to the challenges of securing matching partners in the current bear market conditions, Season 7 will be the final Season of Pomelo Grants, at least until market conditions improve. We are still on track to launch the new [Pomelo Bounties product](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants/introducing-pomelo-bounties-186dc4f617e) shortly after the conclusion of Pomelo Grants Season 7. It will initially support creating and claiming bounties with USDT on EOS, but it will eventually be available on multiple chains including WAX.

## Troubleshooting and Testing  
We continue to play an integral role in creating troubleshooting documents, technical discussion videos, and bug fixes for the Antelope ecosystem.We update to the latest versions of nodeos in order to find issues before they are experienced by many other WAX Guilds and BPs on other Antelope chains. We will be testing the next Antelope pre-release when it becomes available.  
  
For this evaluation period, you’ll notice in the issue names that Matthew Darwin has been testing Leap 5.0. Over in the [Antelope Node Operator Telegram channel](https://t.me/NodeOperatorsRoundtable), Matthew was also active in the recent “pinned build” discussion.  

Here is a list of some of the new contributions and troubleshooting sessions available to the WAX community on GitHub by [Matthew Darwin](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/created_by/matthewdarwin), [Yaro Shkvorets](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3AYaroShkvorets) & [Sajjad Baeidi](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/issues/created_by/sajjadbaeidi).

## Antelope Node Operator Round Table - hosted by EOS Nation
### Background
The Antelope Node Operator Round Table is a weekly roundtable discussion between node operators and core developers to discuss and share feedback on how to improve the Antelope protocol. It’s attended by some of the most technical block producers from the WAX ecosystem, such at EOSphere, EOS USA, and EOS Nation, along with members of the Antelope development team from ENF and OCI, and dedicated members of the Antelope community.

## Firehose and Substreams endpoints for WAX by Pinax
### Background
The [Pinax Firehose and Substream endpoints](https://pinax.network) for WAX are now available to select partners in our closed beta program and already powering WAX products like Bountyblok’s new Staking task. Pinax is operated by the same team behind EOS Nation, focused on developing and operating blockchain agnostic web3 data services compatible with [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/). [Firehose](https://firehose.streamingfast.io/) and [Substreams](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/) are the next generation of history and streaming data technology developed by StreamingFast (the original developers of dfuse) and designed to be more affordable, scalable and reliable than dfuse. [Pinax has ported this technology for Antelope](https://github.com/pinax-network/firehose-antelope) chains and has joined The Graph as core developers and the primary operator of this tech stack. We will be working with chains who are interested in being [integrated with The Graph](https://thegraph.com/blog/chain-integration-process/), including WAX if there is appetite to pursue that from the WAX core team. Regardless of integration with The Graph, our public WAX endpoints will be available soon. We’ll be offering free access and premium paid plans. 
### Latest Updates
This month we developed open source [AtomicMarkets Sales Substreams](https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams-atomicmarket-sales), capable of retrieving data to build market volume charts for collections of NFTs in the AtomicMarket ecosystem. This can already be used today, and is the first building block of more to come soon that will make up the foundation for a new NFT API for WAX and other Antelope blockchains designed to be much more lightweight and performant than the Atomic APIs.
