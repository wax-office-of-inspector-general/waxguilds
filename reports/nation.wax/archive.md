Street.gems:

Street.gems main mission is to celebrate urban culture across decentralized metaverses and to document, produce and exchange values via the medium of WAX NFTs and the Virtual Reality Graffiti Battles are going to be our first events and will highlight the evolution of the Graffiti subculture that is found within the broader street culture. Our first event, Street.gems Season 0, was hosted in Cryptovoxels and had over 1000 visitors to our parcel. WAX logos are featured and we talked about WAX during the stream as the NFTs of the event will be made available on WAX. Participants who wished to vote for their favorite graffiti artists could do so by “voting with their feet” in voxels by moving their avatar from one side of the parcel to another, or by registering with us and claiming their NFT vote tokens from our collection and sending them to their favorite graffiti artist.Since this was our first Street.gems event, we did not advertise this event on our social media as it was meant to be our “beta” trial. Season 1 will take place in early July and be promoted to the best of our abilities.Introduction article: [https://eosnation.io/virtual-reality-graffiti-battles/](https://eosnation.io/virtual-reality-graffiti-battles/)

## WAX Name Service

[WAXnameservice.io](https://waxnameservice.io/) is now live and makes purchasing premium account names on WAX fun and easy. Simply type your desired name into the search bar and see all premium suffixes that are available on the marketplace. All names are priced in WAX and can be purchased by logging in with a WAX account. We support WAX Cloud Wallet, Anchor, and wallets using Scatter’s framework, such as TokenPocket and MYKEY. Anyone can also list their premium names on the market place by interacting with the smart contract through a block explorer.

Status: this is a soft launch of our first MVP of WAX Name Service and hasn’t been publicized broadly yet, but we welcome the community to begin buying and selling WAX names and sharing their feedback. We’re working on creating a user interface built into the marketplace to make it easier and more intuitive for sellers to list their names. You can view all of the suffixes that have already been listed and the amount that have been sold in the [contract tables](https://wax.bloks.io/account/names?loadContract=true&tab=Tables&account=names&scope=names&limit=100&table=suffixes).

### WAX Name Service

Our brand new [Name Service Smart Contract](https://wax.bloks.io/account/names?loadContract=true&tab=Tables&account=names&scope=names&limit=100&table=suffixes) has been deployed to the WAX Mainnet, enabling people to list their premium name suffixes for sale and purchase premium subnames on the WAX Name Service marketplace. There have already been [17 suffixes](https://wax.bloks.io/account/names?loadContract=true&tab=Tables&account=names&scope=names&limit=100&table=suffixes) listed by various community members and name purchases are working as expected.

Suffixes had to be added manually to the marketplace by our team in the old smart contract. But the new smart contract enables users to list their premium suffixes to the marketplace directly. And it has a simplified purchase flow, which will help enable Google Pay and Apple Pay name purchases in the future.

We will be releasing a brand new UI in the coming weeks. It will make the process of listing and purchasing premium subnames on WAX dead simple.

### WAX Detective

We’ve made some minor improvements to WAX Detective this month to improve the user experience, including the addition of a chain selection toggle to easily explore different EOSIO chains. We’re continuing to grow our small early user base, who spent an average of 3:22 exploring WAX Detective per session.

WAX Name Service is now in development. Like its sister, [EOS Name Service](https://eosnameservice.io/), WAX Name Service is a marketplace that makes it easy to buy and sell premium WAX names. Anyone who owns a premium WAX name can make all of its sub-names available on the marketplaces. Buyers simply search for a name and WAX Name Service will display all available sub-names listed on the marketplace by our community members.

The EOS Name Service smart contracts have already been refactored to be more suitable for WAX. waxnameservice.io UI will be coming soon. In the meantime, we’re connecting with community members who’d like to have their premium WAX names listed on the marketplace.

### Community and Marketing

**Running Marketing Campaigns or Hosting Events**:

We host live premiers of our EOS Hot Sauce videos on YouTube every Sunday at noon eastern time and have begun awarding WAX NFTs to participants of our live chat. Participants are required to sign up in advance and provide their WAX account name. Participants without accounts are directed to sign up for a WAX Cloud Wallet. We had more than 70 accounts register to participate ahead of the giveaway in our most recent episode and more than 50 turned out for the premier and participated in the live chat. We gave away 1 GBK goes exotic mega pack, 4 GPK goes exotic regular packs, and 5 of our very own “Spicy Rare” EOS Hot Sauce NFTs. We enjoy pointing out to our viewers how easy it was to create our Spicy Rare NFTs using AttomicAssets on WAX.

We’ve noticed a lot of enthusiasm over NFTs from our community and boosted engagement in our Hot Sauce premiers since we’ve begun giving them away. So we’ve announced a contest that requires holding Spicy Rare NFTs to unlock WAX prizes:

[https://eosnation.io/eos-hot-sauce-spicy-rares/](https://eosnation.io/eos-hot-sauce-spicy-rares/)

# Pre-Evaluation Form Responses

### Please provide some information regarding when and how your Guild got involved with the EOSIO or WAX ecosystem. Links to resources are helpful.

EOS Nation has been heavily involved in the EOSIO ecosystem from the very beginning. Our team formed with a shared vision of a decentralized future. And we all believed EOSIO was the best opportunity for realizing that future. We announced our BP candidacy well ahead of the Mainnet launch:

[https://steemit.com/eos/@daverex/eos-nation-founding-eos-block-producer-candidate](https://steemit.com/eos/@daverex/eos-nation-founding-eos-block-producer-candidate)

Our initial focus was community education and engagement, operating one of the first test networks ([https://steemit.com/eos/@eosnation/eos-io-scholar-testnet](https://steemit.com/eos/@eosnation/eos-io-scholar-testnet)) and launching the first and largest EOS Ambassador program ([https://steemit.com/eos/@eosnation/eos-nation-ambassador](https://steemit.com/eos/@eosnation/eos-nation-ambassador)).

### Has anyone in the Guild previously produced blocks on an EOSIO or DPOS network in the past? If so, which ones and what nodes did they help operate?

EOS Nation has produced blocks on WAX, the EOS Mainnet, BOS, Meet.one, Jungle and Kylin.

### If your Guild has a warrant canary, please provide the link to it.

### If your Guild has a live video inspection of your infrastructure, please provide the link to it.

### Please provide information regarding projects that your Guild is working on to improve the WAX ecosystem. Information about plans, progress, and timelines is helpful. This includes projects that have been submitted for the WAX Guild Showcase program.

We’re committed to leading and contributing to projects that add value to the ecosystem.In pursuit of this mission since well before the EOS Mainnet launched in June 2018, EOS Nation has established itself as a leader in technical expertise in node operation and blockchain forensics. The EOS Nation Validator helps block producers ensure their nodes are up to the latest standards and configured correctly. And EOS Detective puts blockchain forensics analysis at everyone’s fingertips, while also powering KYC services for a number of token sales ongoing on the EOS Mainnet. We made the EOS Nation Validator available to WAX Guild candidates on the day we announced our candidacy. And soon we’ll bring our blockchain forensics capabilities to WAX too.EOS Nation Validator(1) Specific:Category: Infrastructure- Implement the EOS Nation Validator on WAX at

[https://validate.eosnation.io/wax/](https://validate.eosnation.io/wax/)

- Encourage interoperability with other blockchains by using "validation checks" that are similar to other EOSIO blockchains (only differing when specifically needed) and validating that Guilds have their publicly visible Infrastructure configured appropriately.- Aid the office of the Inspector General make informed and objective decisions when selecting quality Guild candidates.(2) Measurable:- Website is running and displaying checks as intended.- At least 5 Guilds show they are in compliance (this shows that the Guilds agree with the way the tool is configured).(3) Assignable:EOS Nation’s Chief Infrastructure Officer, Matthew Darwin, built and maintains the EOS Nation Validator.(4) Realistic:The EOS Nation Validator is already fully implemented and operational on the WAX network.(5) Time-related:The EOS Nation Validator is already completed, pending additional feedback from other Guild members, for which then changes can be discussed.WAX Detective(1) Specific:Category: Blockchain Forensics (Miscellaneous)- Implement EOS Detective on WAX at
