## Announcing our NeftyBlocks Guild Candidacy

## Introduction

NeftyBlocks is a WAX-based NFT platform founded in April 2021 with a passion for empowering NFT enthusiasts around the world. To reach the masses, NFTs should be made simple. When struggling ourselves with creating amazing NFT drops on the WAX Blockchain, we set out to build convenient tools and services for the WAX community to use. Ever since, we are working closely with the community of creators and collectors of WAX to find opportunities to add value to the ecosystem.

Today, we want to continue building on this foundation. At NeftyBlocks we are proud to announce our Guild candidacy on the Worldwide Asset Exchange (WAX) Blockchain.

### Technical Operations

Our experience setting up and maintaining the infrastructure required to run NeftyBlocks fills us with confidence that we can become a reliable block producer on the WAX Blockchain. Learning from the experience of block producers in the space, we aim to raise the bar of infrastructure used to reliably produce blocks on WAX. 
For the test network we choose servers with CPU optimized for single threaded operations and enough resources to handle the current main net workload. 


**Testnet equipment:**
3 x TestNet servers with the following specifications:
-  CPU AMD Ryzen™ 9 5950X 
-  RAM 128 GB DDR4 ECC 
-  Disk NVMe SSD 2 x 3.84 TB

**Setup**
1 x Block producer
1 x chain API host
1 x Atomic API (Coming soon)


For mainnet, due to the higher RAM requirements that are part of the new requirements, we decided to use servers with high-end single thread operations performance and enough RAM to exceed the requirements. We are confident that this setup will be sufficient for the first months and monitor its performance closely.

**MainNet equipment:**
5 x MainNet servers with the following specifications:
- Intel® Xeon® W-2295 RAM
- 320GB DDR4 ECC 
- 2 x 3.84 TB NVMe SSD Datacenter Edition

**Setup**
1 x Block producer
1 x Backup producer
2 x seed nodes and chain API host
1 x Atomic API (Coming soon)

Aside from the equipment used to produce blocks on WAX, we have many more servers in use to support the NeftyBlocks day to day operations. As a guild on the WAX Blockchain, we aim to complement the value we add through the NeftyBlocks platform with continued operational value for the WAX Blockchain.

### Product Development

Since April 2021, we have been fully dedicated to building the NeftyBlocks platform (neftyblocks.com). The NeftyBlocks platform provides convenient tools for creators and collectors to buy, sell and distribute NFTs. Over the past 9 months, we have focussed our development effort on two distinct product categories; Creators and Collectors. 

**Creators**
Being able to sell drops is key to the success of creators. Understanding this, NeftyBlocks provides an easy-to-use UI for creators to sell their packs and NFTs. To deliver on our objective of empowering creators to amaze their communities, we have created a suite of self-service tools that can be accessed through the NeftyBlocks platform or by interacting directly with our publicly available smart contracts. We offer 5 products in this category, all available on the NeftyBlocks platform or by use of the publicly available smart contracts. 

One of the first tools we released was the UI to configure mint-on-demand packs. With this tool, creators can easily configure packs on top of the atomicpacksx contract. Creators can conveniently add unpacking videos to their packs. This tool is available for free to any collection whitelisted on NeftyBlocks or AtomicHub. To improve on that offering, we also provide a pre-minted packs contract with a self-service UI. From December 1st - January 15th 2021, collections on NeftyBlocks created 12k drops. Collectors claimed 218K NFTs across 45K new or returning users. NeftyBlocks provided the opening 120k packs across 13k new or returning users.

Secondly, we offer whitelisting tools to empower creators to sell NFTs to their communities instead of bots. With these tools we give creators the ability to easily create whitelists based on claim keys, proof of ownership (NFTs, Tokens, Schemas, and collections), as well as individual claim limits.

Collection gamification has also been an important feature. The blender is used to allow NFTs to be used as ingredients for a recipe to mint a new NFT. NeftyBlocks provides a GUI to configure blends on top of the blenderizerx contract and a more powerful version of the blends, the super blends, that uses an in house developed contract and provides additional features such as pre-minted results, the possibility to deliver different NFTs based on odds and protect the blends with whitelists among others. From December 1st - January 15th 2021, the blending feature was used by 13K new or returning users performing 190K NFT blends across all collections.  

To cater to the creators' need to collaborate more efficiently, we released tools available to set up a revenue split when creating drops on NeftyBlocks. The value of this tool has been shown by projects such as Upliftworld and Yoshi Drops actively using revenue splitting to collaborate with creators. 

Additionally, customizable collection pages enable creators to create a branded experience for their community without having to create a custom webpage. Seeing many creative collection pages across the collections on WAX, the feature has proven to be popular. We aim to expand this functionality by adding collection-specific data analytics for creators to use.

To bring the most value to the entire community on WAX, we believe anything we create should be accessible to everyone. As such, all smart contracts of the various tools provided to the community are publicly available and can be used by anyone with sufficient skill outside of the NeftyBlocks platform. From December 1st - January 15th 2021, NeftyBlocks had 310k login events by 120k new or returning users to the platform and realized 10.3 mil WAXP in drop & secondary market volume.

**Collectors**
We are proud to have launched the NeftyBlocks secondary market on WAX. The NeftyBlocks marketplace has quickly grown to become the second largest marketplace on WAX. While still in its infancy, we aim for the NeftyBlocks marketplace to become the marketplace of choice for creators and collectors on the WAX Blockchain. We have a dedicated team of in-house UI developers working on the redesign of the marketplace going live in January. From December 1st - January 15th 2021, the NeftyBlocks marketplace had 2,3 mil WAXP in secondary market volume.

## Community and Marketing

Over the last months, we have witnessed and experienced the immense growth of the WAX ecosystem firsthand. The NeftyBlocks platform has served hundreds of thousands of users. We are proud to have surpassed the 14k followers on twitter and are seeing growth across Discord and Instagram. On average, NeftyBlocks.com welcomes 2500 daily unique users (new or returning) who participate in NFT drops, secondary market trading, often also engaging in the NeftyBlocks discord.


**Telegram AtomicDrop Notifier**
We are running a free telegram bot that notifies subscribers whenever a new NeftyBlocks drop is created. This bot is used by collectors to filter and track drops by specific collections, view whitelisted collections or monitor token valuations. As of January 2022, 4850 telegram users are subscribed to the bot.

**TAG - Play to Earn on WAX**
The Adventurer's Guild is an upcoming NFT-based RPG developed by SixPMSoftware, and powered by the WAX Blockchain. For TAG, we are developing smart contracts for the in-game crafting mechanics. We have adapted the superblend contracts to create the ability to add mutable attributes to the result of crafts. In a collaboration effort, we are committed to further develop TAG to become the top playtoearn game on WAX. 

**Engagement efforts**
To stimulate community-wide engagement on WAX, we have birthed the concept of cross-collection packs. A cross collection pack is a collaboration between a large number of collections creating a pack containing NFTs native to those collections. Claiming and unpacking a cross-collection pack puts NFTs from many different collections in the hands of the collectors. This concept has been used by both us and other players on WAX to engage communities. The first cross-collection pack brought together 23 creators and sparked much hype in the WAX community. The second cross-collection pack for Halloween 2021 brought together 39 creators. Additionally, we do co-marketing for verified projects using the NeftyBlocks social media channels. Coming is our own NeftyBlocks youtube channel dedicated to providing learning material for new NFT enthousiast outside of the WAX space looking to start collections and mint NFTs. By becoming a Guild for the WAX Blockchain we want to solidify our position and show our commitment to the WAX ecosystem. 

## Roadmap

We have a growing team of over 10 FTE committed to continuously building and supporting the NeftyBlocks platform. Moreover, we have invested heavily in setting up the required infrastructure to support a consistently increasing number of users coming to WAX and NeftyBlocks. The continuous growth of users within the WAX ecosystem has strengthened our belief that WAX is uniquely positioned to be the blockchain of choice for any NFT enthusiast in the years to come.

As the ecosystem matures, we can grow as a platform. Herein, attracting new users to the WAX ecosystem is key. As such, that is where we will focus our effort in the upcoming months: bringing new users to WAX and NeftyBlocks. We aim to realize this goal by releasing a brand new NeftyBlocks marketplace experience, enhanced creator tools, become a one-stop-shop NFT solution, and interact with the community through learning material.
