**Utility for 3rd party tokens:**

Throughout January 18th - February 18th, we have facilitated 14323 drop claims that use 3rd party tokens native to the projects. We are seeing an explosion in the number of developers building games on WAX. Often, these games have their own in-game token that resides on the WAX Blockchain. With the emergence of these games, comes the desire for utility of their respective tokens. We are supporting these projects by enabling the support of 3rd party tokens as payment methods for NFT drops. As of **Feburary 2022** , we support the following tokens to be used as payments for NFT drops.

| **Token** | **Total claims** |
