### NeftyQuest Release

On April 4th, the NeftyQuest went live. Over the past month, we have created a new and engaging way to trade and collect NFTs on WAX. Since the beginning of NeftyBlocks, we have been looking for ways to help the creators increase their sales on the secondary markets. To accomplish this goal, we have released the NeftyQuest. Released:

* Trading leaderboard where buyers and sellers compete for Experience Points (XP).
* Weekly Quest NFTs that collectors must collect, supporting the creators in the process.
* 'Ruby' loyalty rewards to be exchanged for NFTs and Merchandise (live April 25th)
* NEFTY Prizes that incentivize trading and earning collection fees for creators.

The leaderboard and Ruby rewards are off-chain. We developed an oracle that connects the on-chain trading activity with the off-chain rewards database.


### Bulk Tools release

We have added easy-to-use bulk operations for collectors. Now live are bulk listing NFTs, bulk editing NFTs, bulk burning NFTs, bulk buying NFTs, and bulk transfer NFTs.Additionally, we have released Bulk Pricing. Collectors can now conveniently price NFTs in bulk by a template. This makes it much easier to list NFTs in high supply from Play to Earn games.


### Shareable NFT images release

We have added easily to share images for social media images for NFT collectors to generate through NeftyBlocks.


### Unified Blending contracts

The `blenderizerx` and `blend.nefty` smart contracts have now been unified in the `blend.nefty` contract. Going forward, we are only using this smart contract. This improvement makes it much easier for collectors to navigate through the blending options.


### View and transfer all WAX based tokens

Collectors can now view and transfer any and all tokens native to the WAX Blockchain in their My Wallet section on NeftyBlocks

### Staking to collections (creator features) redesign

Collectors can now stake NEFTY to their collections directly from the My Wallet section on NeftyBlocks


### Creator Verification improvements

Improved verification process to make it harder for projects to scam buyers. We have increased the barrier to becoming NeftyBlocks verified until we find a more sufficient long-term solution.
Reviewed and verified 47 collections (February 27th - April 5th).

### WAX Defi

As a result of the trading and liquidity rewards for collectors, the WAX/NEFTY pool is now the deepest liquidity pool on Alcor. Buyers, sellers, and creators can buy and sell NEFTY in large quantities without affecting the price.

* WAXP side: 754K WAXP
* NEFTY side: 1.9M NEFTY

This proves that if done right, DEFI is a viable opportunity for projects and traders on the WAX Blockchain.


### WAX NFT awareness:

#### Shitcoin Miami sponsorship

We have sponsored and attended Shitcoinconf Miami to promote NFTs on WAX and NeftyBlocks. Spending 2 very exciting days in Miami, NeftyBlocks co-founders Juan and Jose have used a speaker slot to present the WAX Blockchain and the NeftyBlocks platform. This has led to much enthusiasm, network opportunities, and social media coverage.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

We would like to engage in an open discussion with the key players of the WAX Blockchain on how to ensure the WAX Blockchain (governance & development) is aligned with censorship resistance, open standards and the spirit of Web3.
