Metrics period (April 6th - May 23rd):

Secondary market volume: 3.9M WAXP


#### NeftyQuest

On April 4th, the NeftyQuest went live. Since the beginning of NeftyBlocks, we have been looking for ways to help the creators increase their sales on the secondary markets. To accomplish this goal, we have released the NeftyQuest.

Released between April 6th - May 23rd:

Average weekly players: 1094

We made improvements to the NeftyQuest Leaderboard to make it more engaging.


#### Quick Info

We have added quick info to NFTs on the marketplace and in My NFTs. This way, collectors can see at glance all the metadata of an NFT with the click of a button.


#### Improvements to My Collected NFTs

Now, collectors can see if an NFT has backed tokens (WAXP) on the NFT from within the My NFTs page.


#### WAX Defi

As a result of the trading and liquidity rewards for collectors, the WAX/NEFTY pool keeps its number #1 spot as the deepest liquidity pool on the Alcor DEX. Buyers, sellers, and creators can buy and sell NEFTY in large quantities without affecting the price.

WAXP side: 1.1M WAXP (+57%)

NEFTY side: 2.4M NEFTY (+26%)

#### Collection wide blending

We have added more flexibility to blends. Now, creators can have ‘any NFT from a collection’ as an ingredient in a blend.


#### KYB on Collection pages

We have started displaying business information provided by creators on the collection pages. This should increase transparency and improve the trust collectors can have in projects they buy NFTs from. The Company information can be edited from the collection management page

We are working on various different things. We are currently working on the development of an NFT to redeemable items solution. Moreover, we are redesigning the collection pages, among other improvements.


#### Creator Verification

We have reviewed and KYC verified 32 creators over the period of April 6th - May 23rd with our KYC partner. We are reviewing the future of verifications. To increase the transparency of creators to benefit the community, we are exploring radical changes in the way creators are verified.
