### Product #1: NeftyBlocks NFT Marketplace

Development stage: Released

URL: [https://neftyblocks.com/marketplace](https://neftyblocks.com/marketplace)

Trading volume (secondary market):  4.6M WAXP


#### Product Updates:



1. Auctions Release

    We have created and released an advanced NFT auction contract. It is the most flexible contract to auction NFTs on WAX. Users can start 2 types of auctions. 

    English auctions

    ascending price auction. Users place competitive bids until the timer runs out. The highest bidder wins

    Dutch Auctions

    descending price auction. The initial price of the auction decreases periodically until a buyer is found. The first to bid wins the auction.

    Added support for various 3rd party tokens as a payment method for these auctions. 

    Added the ability to schedule a starting date when creating auctions.

    Added the ability to set a Buy Now price for the auction. 



2. Marketplace Rewards

    Over the past 2 months, we have shared 75% of the secondary market fees (‘marketplace fee’) with stakers of the NEFTY token. In accordance with the NEFTY tokenomics, 50% of the secondary market fees will be shared going forward.

    Stats:

    WAXP shared with stakers: 69,396 WAXP 

    NEFTY tokens staked: 10,737,892.75



3. Liquidity Pool Rewards

    The WAX/NEFTY pool kept its number #1 spot as the deepest liquidity pool on the Alcor. Buyers, sellers, and creators can buy and sell NEFTY in large quantities without affecting the price.

    Stats:

    URL: [https://neftyblocks.com/rewards/](https://neftyblocks.com/rewards/)

    WAXP side: 1.1M WAXP (+1%)

    NEFTY side: 3.3M NEFTY (+37%)

    The NEFTY tokenomics serves as proof of concept, showing DeFi on WAX can be an interesting opportunity for projects and traders on the WAX Blockchain.
