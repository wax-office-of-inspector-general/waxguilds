## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Chain congestion

Upon learning about the congestion of the chain, we responded by closely monitoring the producer and the private guild channel. The guilds with more thorough experience have suggested changes and we have applied them to our setup. We have swiftly changed the configuration of our producer to match the recommended setup provided here [https://github.com/EOS-Nation/bpconfig](https://github.com/EOS-Nation/bpconfig). Additionally, we have added two new servers to improve reliability. These servers are configured as a relay node and a sentry node.

Setup:

AMD Ryzen™ 9 5950X

RAM: 128 GB

DDR4 ECC Disk: 2 x 3.84 TB NVMe SSD
