* The Gutter is a lean and unrestricted marketplace. Any NFT listings across any WAX-powered secondary markets show up first on The Gutter. 

##### The Gutter has the following features:

* Instant buying
By clicking this button, users are instantly buying the NFT. We are giving users a chance to score the best deals at their own risk: no further purchase confirmations are shown.

* Auto-Buying
Using this feature, users can instantly and automatically buy NFTs (‘sniping’) off the market. 

* No whitelists
Any NFT that is listed shows up, including non-whitelisted collections. Whitelisted collections have a green “Whitelisted” label. 

* CPU usage
Users pay for the CPU to save you 0,3 seconds on every transaction.

Participants: 56 

On September 30th, we held the first European WAX community event in Hilversum. The first edition of NFT Community Day 2022 was a big success for everyone involved. It got together many big actors of the wax community in real life. The goal of the event was to meet, network, share knowledge and have fun.

Overall, we got a very positive response for attendees. The community event helped start many conversations. Several meaningful topics for determining the future of WAX have been discussed.
