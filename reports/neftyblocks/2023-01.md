### Product #5: Betsify.me Avatar Builder

Period: Period: November 30th, 2022 - January 9th, 2023

Development stage: Released

Main URL: <https://betsify.me/>

Betsify.me is a PFP project that we released on December 15th at 8 PM UTC.

Betisfy.me offers customizable avatars, Betsy NFTs, in which users can mix and match different accessories. Once the user is happy with their avatar's style, they can set it as their profile picture on NeftyBlocks. We have created an engaging experience for Betsy holders on the avatar builder website.

All accessories are NFTs. By using visual layers for each NFT and mutable attributes, you can equip and unequip accessories at any time, while retaining the mint numbers of the NFTs that are used. We have written the smart contract to in the future allow other collections to use this avatar-building feature for their collections.

Soon, a bridging service will be released that allows our customers to bridge their locked Betsy NFTs ('eternal Betsys) to an EVM chain. The community votes between either ETH main-net, Polygon or BNB. The bridging service will be opened to other collections on WAX soon after.
