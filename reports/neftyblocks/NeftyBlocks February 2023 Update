-   You can now set a limit on the number of blends a user can perform to ensure that the blends are distributed fairly among the community of collectors. 

-   Minor fixes

#### Creator Verification

-   We have stopped with verifications and providing KYC badges as it no longer serves the intended purpose. We continue to support and display verification levels based on AtomicHub verification until a new and improved system is in place. 

#### Utility for 3rd party tokens

Development stage: Released

-   We've opened up the possibility of adding a custom token for drops and blends on our platform. Whereas this functionality was first reserved for level 3 staking collections, now, any creator can apply to list their token. Over the past month, we have facilitated 40936 drop claims that use custom WAX-based tokens native to 3rd party projects.

The bridge has been initially enabled for Betsy NFTs. These are profile picture NFTs native to our platform and held by our strongest supporters. Users can now seamlessly bridge their Betsy NFTs between WAX and Polygon.

We offer support for WAX collections that are interested in enabling the bridge for their own collection to an EVM-based chain.  

### Product #5: Betsify.me Avatar Builder

Betsify.me is a PFP project that we released on December 15th at 8 PM UTC.

Betisfy.me offers customizable avatars, Betsy NFTs, in which users can mix and match different accessories. Once the user is happy with their avatar's style, they can set it as their profile picture on NeftyBlocks. We have created an engaging experience for Betsy holders on the avatar builder website.

All accessories are NFTs. By using visual layers for each NFT and mutable attributes, you can equip and unequip accessories at any time, while retaining the mint numbers of the NFTs that are used. We have written the smart contract to in the future allow other collections to use this avatar-building feature for their collections.
