## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Product #1 Waxstash Marketplace. https://waxstash.com | https://waxstash.io
- NFT images and videos are now resized and hosted, compatible with all browsers. This greatly improves loading on mobile browsers in particular. New collection images are resized and added to the image server on a rolling basis in accordance with whitelisted and verified collections
- A rebuild has been started that will intially separate waxstash.com and waxstash.io. The ultimate goal is to have a completely new market with the traditional marketplace features but adding an explorer page, a drops page, and an NFT creation page. The new version will be waxstash.io while the current waxstash.com will continue to exist in its current form in order to support SA listings and multiple token sales until such time these can be merged into the newer UI

Product #2 NFT Pack Breaks. https://packbreaks.io
- 2 new contracts planned. One to serve as a universal pack breaker that will support new packs as they are dropped when pack openings are most in demand. The other will be a repack breaker, which will enable packs to be 're-packed' from existing NFTs to include guarnteed high-value NFTs. the repacks can then be sold by slots just like the current Packbreaks feature.
