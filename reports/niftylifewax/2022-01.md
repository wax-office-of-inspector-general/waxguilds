- Certain requests which should only be needed by a user sporadically are limited to 1 request per second with a burst of 3 requests per IP

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

On January 12th & 13th our testnet producer experienced issues with a node shutdown. After restart there was an issue with the cpu preventing maximum performance scaling. At no time were our two mainnet producers affected, however we did shut down one of the mainnet nodes while we switch to new machines. The testnet node has been restored and is fully within performance specs with no change from the last report.
- WAX.json updated to remove one p2p endpoint and fix the error listing a history endpooint

Our chain-history node is fully sysnced but not yet public. Several issues prevented the Atomic API sync from completing as planned so this will be restarted and it is planned to be ready before the next technical update.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Product #1 Waxstash Marketplace. https://waxstash.com | https://waxstash.io
- The waxstash.com and waxstash.io rebuild is still in development. This is not planned to be complete before the next report.
- 5130 current listings outside of the Atomicmarket contract
- 1968 of the above are atomicassets the rest are simpleassets
- 1249.463 WAX contributed to WAX Defi from wax.stash contract since December 1st 2021
- An additional 995+/- WAX contributed to WAX Defi through waxstash initiated Atomichub sales
- At the time of the writing Atomic APIs are timing out when requesting waxstash marketplace data, therefore atomicassets listing data is unavailable

Product #2 NFT Pack Breaks. https://packbreaks.io
- Packbreaks.io has just been expanded with a new Repack feature. Our repack contract is finished and users can now 'repack' their NFTs into a pack which is apportioned into 10 slots. Each time a slot is purchased all slots are shuffled. Finally when the 10th slot is purchased all slots and NFTs in the repack are shuffled together and airdropped to their respective slots owners
- Repacks also includes a fully on-chain leaderboard, which will track numbers of packs sold & slots bought, as well as total WAX spent & earned. Users can follow the leaderboards and recent repack random transfers at https://packbreaks.io/repacks alongside the available live repacks. And can verify data on-chain in repack.stash contract tables. A marketing effort will take place to include giveaways of NFTs or WAX in accordance with the leaders. Giveaways TDB
- All accounts that participate in repacks accumulate points towards their packs, slots, WAX earned, and WAX spent totals. When an account 'wins' one of our planned giveaways its points are reset to make room for the next top participants to compete for the next giveaway
- Repack Rules:
- 1 - Each repack must contain 10 NFTs from the same collection
- 2 - Each NFT must be unique, meaning no duplicates
- 3 - An account cannot buy slots from their own repack
- 4 - Must be on the atomicassets standard or bridged to atomicassets
- 2.4 WAX contributed to Defi from the first two repacks.
- We listed the first repack after launch for a final test but a full marketing campaign has yet to take place. Marketing and leader giveaways will be planned and executed in the coming weeks
- A universal pack breaker contract is still in the planning stage
