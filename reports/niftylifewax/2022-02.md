## Guild Collaboration, Points Allocation, & Requesting NiFTyLIFE be Retired

NiFTyLIFE and Wizardsguild have executed an agreement to collaborate our efforts in order to better support the WAX blockchain. By combining our expertise in building, refining, and marketing our mutual software and hardware we can provide better products and achieve a greater reach. Please allow the following to serve as instructions for how our agreement is structured and how points should be allocated.

NiFTyLIFE will continue to operate as a seperate company, owning, developing, and improving upon our current products and hardware. Wizardsguild will provide hardware and marketing support. Pursuant to the agreement 100% of the points NiFTyLIFE activity earns should be allocated to Wizardsguild. NiFTyLIFE's activity must include at least the development and maintenance of waxstash and packbreaks, additional tools and services may built or provided by NiFTyLIFE as well but are not required. Wizardsguild Guild reports will include NiFTyLIFE's products and activity just as the same would be reported by us if we were submitting our full reports and all points earned by us and reported in Wizardsguild reports shall be 100% allocated to Wizardsguild. Wizardsguild obligations to support our products and activity include providing all the hardware and APIs we may need, marketing, generating reports, and other mutual activity.

Our agreement is structured such that either party may end it for any reason upon proper notice. Since our products and activity will be included in Wizardsguild's reports, NiFTyLIFE will no longer submit reports and we request that our guild be retired until such time we request reinstatement. In the event we do request reinstatement all NiFTyLIFE point allocations to Wizardsguild shall cease, unless otherwise stated in the request.

NiFTyLIFE is currently in standby status until March 15th. All hardware, technical services, and APIs provided by us will continue to be maintained at least until then.

Thank you.
