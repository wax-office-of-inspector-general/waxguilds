## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Half of the year is over and has passed in a flash. It’s been transformational for the team here at OIAC. A total overhaul of infrastructure has been completed since the appointment of our new CTO and the performance is showing that it has been successful.

* Atomic API running.
* Hyperion running.
* Failover solution configured.
* Internal documentation complete.

Next month:

* Focus will be on continued proactive and reactive monitoring to ensure stability and a high level of availability at all times.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

## OIAC NFT

* Development of this product has been put on hold for now as we focus on other products taht can be developed and delivered in a shorter timeframe and without the same associated costs.

## Carbon Impact Calculator

* Development work continues on our carbon calculator that helps value a given NFT wallet to identify how many vIRL tokens would need to be purchased to offset the carbon generated not only in the creation, but in the lifespan too.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

No

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

* The journey we have been on has been made possible by the support of the OIG as well as many other guilds and we are really grateful for all the helpful pointers and questions answered. 

We have decided to collate and document the journey to be able to assist new guilds in the future in the form of a wiki available to all. Essentially we’re are creating the guide we wish we had. 

We hope that the wiki will have value to existing guilds too with hints and tips for performance enhancements.
