## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Itâ€™s been almost a year since OIAC was created and we are delighted that we have successfully achieved the minimum requirements to become a standby guild. We are excited to continue with the next step of our journey with the support and investment that being a standby brings. 

We have been concentrating on ensuring stability of our infrastructure since the last update. 

* Atomic API running.
* Hyperion running.
* Failover solution configured.
* Internal documentation complete.

Next month:

* Focus will be on continued proactive and reactive monitoring to ensure stability and a high level of availability at all times.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

## OIAC NFT

* Development of this product will be recommenced once resources are available which we expect to be over the next 2-4 months.

## Carbon Impact Calculator

* Development work continues on our carbon calculator that helps value a given NFT wallet to identify how many vIRL tokens would need to be purchased to offset the carbon generated not only in the creation, but in the lifespan too.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

With regards to the recent issues being experienced on the network, we have been doing our best ot understand the issues and help to find a solution. We joined the zoom call on the 31st of August with others in the community, but unfortunatly we had nothing productive to offer as we have not been producing blocks.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

* We launched a wiki that we hope would provide a central point for any new guilds to assist in core learning about the WAX network. Essentially the guide we wish we had when we first started. We have been developing the guide ever since (and plan to continue to do so) and believe that there will be use for more experienced existing guilds too.
