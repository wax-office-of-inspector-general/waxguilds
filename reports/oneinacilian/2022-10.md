## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

As we hurtle into the fourth quarter and wonder where 2022 has disappeared to, we have certainly been busy here at OIAC towers.

Further infrastructure improvements have taken place including an upgraded Hyperion server to ensure we can provide full history for a longer period of time. 

Next month:

* It is becoming clearer to us that running full history is going to be more of a challenge as time passes, and so we are exploring options that can facilitate a 6 week history solution using ES7 compressed snapshots to share with the community.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

## 6 Week Hyperion Snapshot

* We are developing a tool that will allow guilds to ensure their elasticsearch indexes can be trimmed down to a 6 week period. Guilds will use their initial snapshot on OIAC machines reducing to 6 weeks without the need to run another snapshot. The tool is in the later stages of testing but we hope that it will be live in the coming weeks as we can foresee a greater demand following the recent changes to the evaluation of partial Hyperion solutions. 

## OIAC NFT

* Development of this product will be recommenced once resources are available, however due to other projects taking priority, this is more likely to have a 6 - 12 month timeframe now.

## Carbon Impact Calculator

* Development work continues on our carbon calculator that helps value a given NFT wallet to identify how many vIRL tokens would need to be purchased to offset the carbon generated not only in the creation, but in the lifespan too.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

With regards to the recent issues being experienced on the network, we have been doing our best ot understand the issues and help to find a solution. We joined the zoom call on the 31st of August with others in the community, but unfortunatly we had nothing productive to offer as we have not been producing blocks.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

* We have been in touch with Ross from Eosphere and he is happy for us to publish our partial snapshots on the snapshot Telegram channel that the wider community are already familiar with and use regularly.

* We continue to develop our wiki with useful guides and enhancements. We understand that it is providing value to not only new aspiring guilds but also to existing guilds.
