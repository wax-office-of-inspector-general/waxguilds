## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

In these uncertain times it is a difficult time for a fledgling guild, and we have had to take stock of all current arrangements as well as reevaluate plans for the future in the knowledge that funds will not stretch as far. 

With this in mind we have been focusing on ensuring infrastructure stability with maximum uptime. We have also been working on creating partial history snapshots which we feel could be very useful to those wishing to switch from full history provision as part of a cost cutting exercise.

## 6 Week Hyperion Snapshot

* The ES snapshot contains 6 weeks of blockchain indexed data. Guilds can find the snapshot on the Eosphere snapshot telegram channel seeing as this is already used by the community for full history snapshots, Ross has kindly let us share. 

We have a section in the OIAC wiki dedicated to the partial snapshots. https://wiki.oiac.io/snapshots/ which explains the process of how to configure the repository, listing the desired snapshot to restore as well as the process required for the restoration to take place.

Each snapshot is validated for missing blocks using Hyperion 3.3.6 API. All blocks are indexed fully up to the time the snapshot was taken (i.e. snapshot date created Nov 21, 2022 8:35 PM GMT+2 will be indexed until that time) 
The name of the snapshot will be date from when indexed data will exist (i.e. 09-10-2022-partial-hyperion-13ibqjmnq8eweed_f79q6q will contain indexed data from 09-10-2022 00:00:00)

We have a dedicated cluster [4 es instances] running with optimizations and proper sharding to optimize the clean-up operations so that the snapshots can be made available daily and in a timely fashion.
Regular restores are tested as well with the indexer operations validated

## OIAC NFT

* Development of this product will be recommenced once resources are available, however due to other projects taking priority, this is more likely to have a 6 - 12 month timeframe now.

## Carbon Impact Calculator

* Development work has been paused for now on our carbon calculator that helps value a given NFT wallet to identify how many vIRL tokens would need to be purchased to offset the carbon generated not only in the creation, but in the lifespan too.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

No

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

* We have been in touch with Ross from Eosphere and he is happy for us to publish our partial snapshots on the snapshot Telegram channel that the wider community are already familiar with and use regularly.

* We continue to develop and improve our wiki which we believe will prove to be a very valuable asset for other guilds, especially those new to WAX.
