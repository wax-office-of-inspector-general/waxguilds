## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

It's a new year, and we are doing our best to muster all the positivity we can for the outlook for the year ahead!

Uncertainty is keeping our current development plans cautious. As mentioned previously, it is a difficult time for a fledgling guild, and we have had to take stock of all current arrangements as well as reevaluate plans for the future in the knowledge that funds will not stretch as far. 

Our partial history restores are regularly tested with the indexer operations validated.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

## 6 Week Hyperion Snapshot

* The ES snapshot contains 6 weeks of blockchain indexed data. 

 https://wiki.oiac.io/snapshots/ provides an explanation of how to configure the repository, listing the desired snapshot to restore as well as the process required for the restoration to take place.

Each snapshot is validated for missing blocks using Hyperion 3.3.6 API. All blocks are indexed fully up to the time the snapshot was taken.

We have a dedicated cluster [4 es instances] running with optimizations and proper sharding to optimize the clean-up operations so that the snapshots can be made available daily and in a timely fashion.

## OIAC NFT

* Development of this product will be recommenced once resources are available, however due to other projects taking priority, this is more likely to have a 6 - 12 month timeframe now.
