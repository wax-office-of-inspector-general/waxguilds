## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Since our last update we have been busy preparing for the upgrade to Antelope 3.1 ensuing everything will be complete and running smoothly before the 27th of March deadline.

Testnet BP has been upgraded to leap 3.1.3wax01. Testnet SHIP has also been upgraded to leap 3.1.3wax01.

The upgrade of our main net SHIP to leap 3.1.3wax01 is scheduled to be completed by the 15th of March at the latest.  

During the next evaluation period we plan to increase volume on ES node cluster for snapshots to maintain data for at least 90 days. We are also looking to automate snapshot maintenance, including cleanup and testing, with the goal of providing more regular snapshots.

lastly we plan to upgrade Hyperion to latest stable release in the coming weeks.

## 6 Week Hyperion Snapshot

Regular maintenenece and testing continues in order to provide regular snapshots which includes the latest 6 weeks of data for partial history restore including up to 75 days worth of data.


* The ES snapshot contains 6 weeks of blockchain indexed data. 

 https://wiki.oiac.io/snapshots/ provides an explanation of how to configure the repository, listing the desired snapshot to restore as well as the process required for the restoration to take place.

Each snapshot is validated for missing blocks using Hyperion 3.3.6 API. All blocks are indexed fully up to the time the snapshot was taken.

We have a dedicated cluster [4 es instances] running with optimizations and proper sharding to optimize the clean-up operations so that the snapshots can be made available daily and in a timely fashion.
