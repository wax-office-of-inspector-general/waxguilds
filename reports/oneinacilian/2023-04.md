## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Since our last update we completed the upgrade to Antelope 3.1 successfully and following the upgrade we stepped up monitoring and testing to ensure stability and maximum uptime. 

Hyperion has been upgraded to the latest stable release. 

As per our plan set out in our previous update we have successfully increased volume on ES node cluster for snapshots to maintain data for at least 90 days. We continue to improve on the automation of snapshot maintenance, including cleanup and testing. The goal is to provide more regular snapshots, and this is indeed coming to fruition.

## DelphiOracle Interface

Having noticed a conversation regarding the potential benefit, to guilds in the community, of having an interface on the DelphiOricle focusing on pairs and bounty, we are working on developing such a tool and aim to have this functional during the next evaluation period.

## 6 Week Hyperion Snapshot

Regular maintenenece and testing continues in order to provide regular snapshots which includes the latest 6 weeks of data for partial history restore including up to 90 days worth of data.

Current size of index (for partial) is roughly 1.1TB. 

* The ES snapshot contains 6 weeks of blockchain indexed data. 

 https://wiki.oiac.io/snapshots/ provides an explanation of how to configure the repository, listing the desired snapshot to restore as well as the process required for the restoration to take place.

Each snapshot is validated for missing blocks using Hyperion 3.3.6 API. All blocks are indexed fully up to the time the snapshot was taken.

We have a dedicated cluster [4 es instances] running with optimizations and proper sharding to optimize the clean-up operations so that the snapshots can be made available daily and in a timely fashion.
