## Docker Project

We are excited to announce that we have made significant progress in bootstrapping two core WAX systems within a containerised environment. This development allows for quick and easy deployments, enabling efficient testing of upgrades and meeting various engineering requirements and deliverables.

In our previous build, we successfully deployed a fully functional Hyperion stack using a deployable Dockerfile build. You can find the details and instructions in the following repository: https://github.com/oneinacillian/docker-build-hyperion-es8. This build has been available since June and has been instrumental in facilitating testing and development.

We are pleased to share that we have recently added another valuable component to our containerised environment. We have introduced a complete Atomic API stack with its own Docker build. The details and instructions for this build can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/oneinacillian/docker-build-atomic.git. This recent addition further enhances our testing capabilities and expands the range of possibilities for development and optimisation.

Both builds are readily available for quick testing, and we welcome any feedback and recommendations from the community. By following the provided instructions, you will be able to set up the entire solution within minutes. We have also included configurable parameters to optimise various elements of the application.

We encourage you to explore these builds, engage in testing, and provide your thoughts. Your contributions will help us refine and enhance the functionality of these systems.
