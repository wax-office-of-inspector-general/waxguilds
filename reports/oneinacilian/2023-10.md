## Missing & Empty Blocks Monitoring Tool

We've been closely collaborating with Sentnl to develop and maintain the infrastructure for the Blocks Monitoring Tool. Our primary goal is to ensure uninterrupted and continuous operation of this tool. 

We've agreed on a distribution of any points awarded for this joint effort, with Sentnl receiving 80% and OIAC receiving 20%.

We acquired an AX102 instance for hosting the Missing Blocks app on both MAINNET and TESTNET, as well as for future development and hosting. To ensure real-time data streaming and high availability, we've set up localized Ship and Hyperion container instances on the same host. Data integrity is a priority, with all data for the Blocks App, Hyperion, and Ship stored in separate external volumes for minimized data loss risk during container runtime. For security, we've tightly controlled the entry point through a localhost-bound proxy.

In the near future, we plan to enhance our infrastructure further by migrating to a more resilient orchestrator using Kubernetes, improving maintenance and capabilities.
