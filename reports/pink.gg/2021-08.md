- Backed Tokens Filter in Inventory
- Exclude owned items when creating a tradeoffer
- Display lowest listing in asset popover

We've also been working on some bigger improvements / features which we will soon be able to release. Among them:
- Notification System

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

We have worked together with various teams on their NFT launches in the last month:
- Bitcoin Origin Moment 7

- UltraRare - Ultracomix

We have also been talking to the NFT Draft team and giving them advice.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We have been working on a knowledgebase / FAQ, mostly centered around AtomicAssets, to help answer the common questions of our users. This is close to completion but not released yet. It will most likely be released throughout the next month.

We have set up a feedback site to gather suggestions and ideas from AtomicHub users, so that we can take into account what features users want to see when deciding what next to work on: https://feedback.atomichub.io/

## Strategic Contribution

We believe that the AtomicAssets API that we have developed and keep improving should be counted as a strategic contribution in the category of "History and API Solutions", considering it's one of the most used APIs in the ecosystem.
