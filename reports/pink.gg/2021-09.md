## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

We are continuing to improve AtomicHub as always. Last months' updates include:

- Allow searching by name that is not saved in the template for special collections (kogs tubes, facing packs)
- Allow users to filter transfers by collection
- Allow clicking through NFT media in fullscreen mode
- See WAX spent and wax earned filtered by collection on profile
- Hover over USD price to see used WAX exchange rate (better handling for history exchange rates)
- Collection book page is now editable
- Collections can specify their market filters
- Toggle between WAX and USD graph
- Add purchase price to listing modal if user purchased it
- Confirm modal when adding collections to personal blacklist
- Ability to open NFT data popover on mobile

We have also already completed the implementation of Buyoffers, however we decided to hold that feature back until we can release it simultaneously with the new Notification System.
We have spent a lot of energy on the new NFT Creator and plan to release it in October.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

We have worked together with two teams on their NFT launches in the last month:
- KOGS Bad Days
- Bitcoin Origin M8

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We have published the AtomicAssets / AtomicHub knowledgebase that we mentioned in last month's report: https://support.pink.gg/hc/en-us

We have acquired NFT Insider, a well known WAX NFT News site. (https://nftinsider.io/acquisition/)  
This acquisition, along with the founder John joining our team full time, will allow us to significantly step up our community engagement. Since joining, John has already created a bunch of high quality articles on NFT Insider, as well as having taken over our Twitter account to make that more active.  
We have a ton of plans for the content that we will produce along with the ways we can engage the community in that. The first step will be launching an actively moderated Discord Server very soon after writing this report.
