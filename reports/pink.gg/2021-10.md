## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

We are continuing to improve AtomicHub as always. Last months' updates include:

- Multi select NFTs in inventory
- Bulk list at lowest market price 
- Allow creators to define filters for their collections
- Hide collections in inventory filter
- Allow to search by name that is not saved in the template for special collections (kogs tubes, facing packs)
- Allow users to filter transfers by collection
- Click through NFT media in fullscreen mode
- See wax spent and wax earned filtered by collection on profile
- Hover over usd price to see used wax exchange rate (better handling for history exchange rates)
- Better errors when you mistype something

Unlike previously planned, we will likely not release the new NFT Creator in October, but we have made good progress and will soon begin beta tests with trusted creators.
