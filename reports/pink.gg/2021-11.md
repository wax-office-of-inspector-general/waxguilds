### AtomicAssets

AtomicAssets is a NFT Standard used by around one million accounts per month

### AtomicHub / AtomicMarket

In the last month, there were around 1.7 million sales totaling around $250 million.

We are continuing to improve AtomicHub as always. The key things we've been working on are:

- New NFT Creator closed beta: Some creators have been given access to the beta version of our new NFT creator. We plan to fix some bugs and improve the usability in the coming month and then release it to the public.
- Improved handling for 1/1 NFTs (e.g. generative NFTs), especially related to the suggested price and displaying a floor price.
- Collection Book Creator: Relatively rough, but fully functional interface for creators to set up their own Set / Collection Book that will show up on AtomicHub.
- A gradual redesign for AtomicHub: Starting with collection pages and the landing page. We are convinced that the new designs will offer significant improvements and will be instrumental in both onboarding new users and retaining existing ones.
- Significant improvements to the infrastructure behind AtomicHub. We are able to handle significantly more traffic now compared to one month ago and plan to further improve this significantly.

### AtomicPacks

Atomicpacks is continuing to be used actively, however we have not worked on the existing smart contract for the last month. We are rather planning to build a new and improved smart contract, which we then plan to integrate on AtomicHub through a user friendly pack creator. \
To be clear, building a pack creator has been the plan for AtomicPacks since we first built it, but we didn't so far since Neftyblocks built a good interface for the smart contract and we thus felt like our time was better spent building other features. Now, we feel that we can improve the smart contract significantly to then offer a significantly more useful product to our users.

### NFT Insider

Although also partially rated in the Community and Marketing category, we want to propose that NFT Insider is valuable and independent enough to be rated as a product, rather than just as the content that is created for it.

NFT Insider (https://nftinsider.io/) is putting out content almost daily, both in the form of articles, in the form of videos and recently also in the form of a podcast. It features extensive interviews with figures from the WAX NFT ecosystem, in depth articles and opinion pieces, weekly updates, and the Weekly Launch Calendar that is put out every Sunday.

The website received more than 65k pageviews last month (which isn't counting the engagement on the videos and on social media) and adds significant value to the ecosystem.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

- We worked with the Project Deep Mine team on their initial pack launch
- We worked with R2 and EOS Amsterdam on the R2 GeePeeKay launch, featuring the most complex and custom upgrading system we have devfeloped to date. As always, EOS Amsterdam (WAX Amsterdam) should receive the points for this engagement if they also mention it in their report.
- We worked with the DracoDice team on their initial pack launch

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

- We added a full time community manager to our team (next to John who handles both content creation and community management)
- Our socials have been very active and are seeing good activity
- We have started publishing "Atomic AMA", a weekly interview format around 10 minutes long, where John and Jona chat about recent developments, explain what we have been working on, and answer community questions. We believe that this is a great way to make sure that we stay close to the community.
- We have created and published a large number of high quality articles on https://nftinsider.io/
