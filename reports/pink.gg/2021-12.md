### AtomicAssets

AtomicAssets is a NFT Standard used by around one million accounts per month

In the last month, there were around 1.5 million sales totaling around $234 million.

We are continuing to improve AtomicHub as always. The key things we've been working on are:

- We made some very significant performance improvements to our APIs, which improves the user experience, especially when utilizing the AtomicHub marketplace
- We added buyoffers, allowing users to offer WAX tokens for NFTs
- We added a light notification system, letting users know when they received tradeoffers or buyoffers.
- We made various smaller UX/UI improvements, e.g. for the navigation, profiles section, footer, login modal
- We built a system to automatically combat certain kinds of scammers

### AtomicPacks

We have not made any changes to AtomicPacks, but still plan to build an improved v2 version soon.

### NFT Insider

NFT Insider is continuing to grow and put out highly relevant content for the WAX community. We recently had a Russian content creator join the team, with plans to soon also cater towards the Russian community with NFT Insider.

NFT Insider has also started a collaboration with Rob from TokenGamer on a podcast called "WAX Lyrical". We agreed that TokenGamer should get the full points for this collaboration.
