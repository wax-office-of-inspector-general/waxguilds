## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### AtomicAssets

AtomicAssets has recently reached the milestone of 200 million NFTs created.

### AtomicHub / AtomicMarket

In the last month, there were around 1.9 million sales totaling around $20 million.

We are continuing to improve AtomicHub as always. There have not been a lot of big releases, but work being done on a lot of different features like:

- Redesign of the Explorer page
- Redesign of the Trading page
- Finalization the new NFT Creator
- Social profile integration for AtomicHub profiles
- Messaging system

There have also been some smaller but noticable changes that were released:
- Improved market search suggestions
- Significantly improved site performance
- and various smaller changes and bugfixes

### AtomicPacks / AtomicDrops

No news

### NFT Insider

We have onboarded a new full time content writer for NFT Insider, allowing us to significantly increase our output of high quality content. Next to existing written articles, we are experimenting with more video content and aim to further build this out.

### Collection Whitelistings / Verifications

We would again like to propose counting the collection whitelistings and verifications we do as a product. Design for use with AtomicHub primarily, it is now being used by most other NFT related dapps on WAX, including the WAX Cloud Wallet, NFT Hive and Neftyblocks. It is furthermore being required by a lot of other dapps and projects.
We now have two full time employees working on whitelistings and verifications, with a freelancer helping out and another full time employee providing guidance.
We are furthermore working on a custom made tool that will allow us to streamline the process and to offer the best possible experience for new creators while keeping standards to a high and consistent level.
We feel that given both the resources we invest into this and the use that the WAX ecosystem gets out of this, it would be fair to count this as a product.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

- We worked with UltraRare on their new pack launch
- We have worked with R2 / EOS Amsterdam on the new R2 Baddays launch. We have built a custom crafting interface for this. As always, if EOS Amsterdam should also claim points for this project, all points should go to them.

We are following a large number of leads for possible future cooperation at the moment and will share more details when things materialize.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We have taken part in the digital DYGYCON 8 event. Like last time, we booked an entire expo hall and gave booths away to various projects in the AtomicAssets ecosystem.
It again was a huge success, with even more exhibitors than last time, and with AtomicHub being the most visited booth of the whole event (next to the free SWAG booth).

We have also confirmed our Platinum sponsorship of the NFT.NYC conference in June, where we will attend and will tell people both about AtomicHub and about the WAX ecosystem as a whole.

Furthermore:

- We have been running weekly Discord stages and Twitter spaces, talking to the community and highliting creators
- Our socials have been very active and are seeing good activity
- We have created and published a large number of high quality articles on https://nftinsider.io/
- We are creating weekly Blockchain Bulletin videos on the [NFT Insider Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/NFTInsider)
- We are creating weekly Atomic AMA videos on the [AtomicHub Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAEv4HpnBJCcql5iWo7p2tQ)
