AtomicAssets has reached 275 million NFTs created on WAX, 75 million more than at the time of the last report

### AtomicHub / AtomicMarket

We are continuing to improve AtomicHub as always and have released a number of big changes, most noteably:
- V2 version of the NFT Creator
- Redesign of the Explorer
- Blog directly on AtomicHub

There have also been some smaller but noticable changes that were released:
- Improved image resizing service (signficiantly faster)
- Updated bootstrap version, which allows for better UI on big screens

At the same time, we are of course working on other things that have not been released yet, including a trading page redesign, our new notification system, and a messaging system

### AtomicPacks / AtomicDrops

No news

### NFT Insider

We are continuing to publish multiple high quality articles every week, and are working on plans to further expand the reach that NFT Insider has.

### Collection Whitelistings / Verifications

We have spent a lot of energy in the last month thinking about how we want the whitelisting / verification system to work and which changes we want to make to it. We are aware that while it is a very valuable tool the ecosystem, it can be improved by making it more transparent and by making it more clear what a whitelisting / verification means, and also what it doesn't mean. We expect to be able to announce changes in the coming month,

While this is going on, we are of course contiuing to process whitelisting applications.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

We have closed a strategic partnership that we believe has the potential to be very valuable to the AtomicHub userbase and to the ecosystem as a whole, which we will be able to announce soon.

Furthermore, we are in late stages of discussion with multiple other companies, each in very different but very relevant fields, and hope to be able to announce meaningful partnerships coming from this in the coming weeks and months.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We have taken part in the digital DYGYCON 9 event. Like before, we booked an entire expo hall and gave booths away to various projects in the AtomicAssets ecosystem.
The presence of the WAX community at DYGYCON keeps growing, and we believe it again was a great success.

We are preparing for the NFT.NYC conference next month and are looking forward to representing AtomicHub and WAX there.

Furthermore (like last time):

- We have been running weekly Discord stages and Twitter spaces, talking to the community and highliting creators
- Our socials have been very active and are seeing good activity
- We have created and published a large number of high quality articles on https://nftinsider.io/
- We are creating weekly Atomic AMA videos on the [AtomicHub Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAEv4HpnBJCcql5iWo7p2tQ)
