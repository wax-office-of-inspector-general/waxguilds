We added support for 3.1 to the atomicassets api together with other speed and storage optimizations

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### AtomicAssets

AtomicAssets has reached 318 million NFTs created on WAX, almost 50 million more than at the time of the last report

### AtomicHub / AtomicMarket

We are continuing to improve AtomicHub as always and have released a number of big changes, most noteably:
- Trading redesign, significantly improving the user experience and putting more emphasis on trading with other users with similar interests
- Drop launch calendar, which allows creators to highlight their upcoming drops and collectors to stay informed about what is happening in the ecosystem
- Friends system, aiming to connect users with similar interests to improve the user experience and make users more engaged in the ecosystem

There have been lots of other smaller changes that improve the UX/UI or fix small bugs. We have also focused on redesigning large parts of our backend to make the system more scalable for future growth.

### AtomicPacks / AtomicDrops

No updates. We are working on a completely new primary sale module with a focus on ease of buying and tax compliance.

### NFT Insider

The NFT Insider team has grown to 4 full time employees, who are working on content creation in the form of articles, videos, short form content and social media posts aiming to propel the NFT system in general and the WAX ecosystem in particular.

### Collection Whitelistings / Verifications

We have published a proposal for an updated verification system and received a lot of community feedback. We have taken this feedback into account and will release an updated proposal soon. After releasing that, we will again listen to the community's feedback and either make more changes or release the new system.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

We have partnered with Banxa, enabling us to offer a Fiat to WAX onramp directly on AtomicHub, as well as a Fiat to NFT checkout flow, allowing users to purchase NFTs using their fiat payment methods like credit cards. \
We have seen well over $1MM in transaction volume since the introduction of this feature.

We have a large number of ongoing conversations with different types of partners, talking both about partnerships in which we would assist the partner with launching NFT projects on AtomicHub, and about partnerships that would improve the quality of our existing products.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We have participated in the NFT.NYC conference in June, exhibiting with an AtomicHub booth. We have produced unique SWAG (in particular hoodies and tshirts with unique NFTs attached) that we gave out for free at the event, which we received very positive feedback about. We have been able to educate a large number of attendees about AtomicHub and WAX, and have made a number of valuable business connections.

We have announced our first in person community event, AtomicHub Live London. It will be completely free to attend on November 2nd (the day before NFT.London starts). Our goal is the bring the WAX and EOS NFT communities together to connect in person, as well as to raise awareness about AtomicHub and the ecosystems surrounding it. We already have over 250 RSVPs and expect this number to further increase leading up the the event. More information can be found on [live.atomichub.io](https://live.atomichub.io/)

We will also be exhibiting at the NFT.London event, again representing AtomicHub with the goal of educating attendees about what we are doing and raising awareness.

We have continued to attend the online DYGYCON community events.

Furthermore (like last time):

- We have been running weekly Discord stages and Twitter spaces, talking to the community and highliting creators
- Our socials have been very active and are seeing good activity
- We have created and published a large number of high quality articles on https://nftinsider.io/
- We are creating (now bi-weekly) Atomic AMA videos on the [AtomicHub Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAEv4HpnBJCcql5iWo7p2tQ)
