## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### AtomicAssets

AtomicAssets has reached 327 million NFTs created on WAX, 9 million more than at the time of the last report

### AtomicHub / AtomicMarket

The two most notable features we released since our last update are:
- Carbon Offsetting at the point of sale - We partnered with Meta Carbon to allow AtomicHub users to offset CO2 emissions at the point of sale when buying an NFT. This is transparently recorded on the blocchain and then goes towards a project of the users choosing, flipping the narrative about NFTs being bad for the environment.
- Unlockable Content - Creators can specify unlockable content attributes for their NFTs or templates, which can only be seen by the owner of the NFT.

We also made a number of small improvements and bugfixes as always.

### AtomicPacks / AtomicDrops

No updates. The work on our planned new drop functionality is progressing, in particular in respect to getting certainty around the correct international tax treatment.

### NFT Insider

NFT Insider continues to create high quality content and has been focussing on creating more video content in particular.

NFT Insider has also been a media partner at a number of in person events, or covering them independently:

- NFT.London
- NBX Berlin
- Philippine Web3 Festival

### Collection Whitelistings / Verifications

After having published the 2nd whitelisting system proposal, we have received a lot of feedback, both online and in person at AtomicHub Live (more on that below), and feel we now have a good grasp on what the updated system should look like. We will release more details soon.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

We believe the partnership with Meta Carbon mentioned above to be very significant, because it allows us to aggressively challenge the notion of NFTs being bad for the environment.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We have successfully hosted our first ever in person Community Event "AtomicHub Live: London"

Attendance we completely free, and we organized a venue, merch for all attendees, as well as a highly relevant program of speakers and panelists.

The event was a big success, bringing together around 150-200 people from the WAX community, as well as some new people who were curious to learn more about what is going on in the space.

We have also attended the NFT.London and NBX Berlin conferences as exhibitors, as always representing AtomicHub and indirectly WAX, looking for potential partners as well as raising awareness.

Furthermore (like last time):

- We have been running Discord stages and Twitter spaces, talking to the community and highliting creators
- Our socials have been active and are seeing good activity
- We have created and published a large number of high quality articles on https://nftinsider.io/
- We are creating bi-weekly Atomic AMA videos on the [AtomicHub Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAEv4HpnBJCcql5iWo7p2tQ)
