## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

We have launched the AtomicHub Launchpad, a bespoke primary sale solution which allows IP holders, game studios and brands to bring their NFT project to market.

We held the first drop on the Launchpad on March 1st, releasing a series of officially licensed phygital Ultraman NFTs. The drop received significant interest, selling over $120k worth of NFTs to more than 1,000 customers.

We have a pipeline of 30+ projects in various stages of conversation, and we expect to be able to bring a significant amount of high quality content to WAX in the future through this initiative.

We have attended NFT.NYC, representing AtomicHub with one of the largest booths at the convention. We were able to inform thousands of attendees about AtomicHub and WAX, as well as meet a number of people from the WAX ecosystem.
