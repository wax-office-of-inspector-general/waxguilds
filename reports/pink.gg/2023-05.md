## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### AtomicAssets

AtomicAssets has reached 370 million NFTs created on WAX, 7 million more than at the time of the last report

### AtomicHub / AtomicMarket

The two most notable features we released since our last update are:
- Badge System: Replacing the previous whitelisting / verification system, we have rolled out badges. These are designed to give our users the most information possible to make an own informed decision, and also makes the process more objective for creators.
- Bulk Listing Modal: Giving users more options to conveniently list multiple NFTs for sale at the same time.

We also released a large number of small improvements and bugfixes as always.

### AtomicPacks / AtomicDrops

No updates.

### NFT Insider

NFT Insider continues to create high quality content, focusing esepcially on WAX and IMX in recent months.

Since the last update, a bigger focus has been put on video content, and the initial feedback and reception has been positive.

### Badge System

As mentioned above, we have released our new badge system, which replaces the existing whitelisting system.
A lot of the checks we conduct remain the same, and we still allow collections to apply for badges like Content (where we check that the content is not stolen and does not violate any copyrights), Identity (where we conduct a KYC check on the creator) and Business (where we conduct a KYB check on the business behind a collection).
There also are dynamic badges, e.g. based on collection age or market volume, which is given to collections to add additional context for our users.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

We had three new Launchpad sales since the last update: ZOS, Apex Kings and Avalon. We have signed multiple contracts for further drops, which will be announced over the coming weeks and months.

We expect to be able to bring a significant amount of high quality content to WAX in the future through this initiative.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We have been working on a big community event for the last few months, which we will announce shortly.

Furthermore (like last time):

- We have been running Discord stages and Twitter spaces, talking to the community and highliting creators
- Our socials have been active and are seeing good activity
- We have created and published a large number of high quality articles on https://nftinsider.io/
