## June 2021

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

No updates

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

We keep working hard on all things related to AtomicAssets and AtomicHub. Over the last month, we focused on lots of small QoL improvements as well as refactoring our codebase, as we are training 2 new full time devs in our team.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?**

- We worked with UltraRare on their new The Horrors pack launch
- We worked with the BTCO team on their pack launch

(If another guild mentions this in their report, they should get the full points. We just handle the smart contracts.)

- We worked with Onessus on their Boysterous as well as their Void Elementals pack launches

## May 2021

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

We have improved our node infrastructure significantly and are now again using our own cluster of nodes to handle AtomicHub traffic.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

Once again, AtomicHub and AtomicAssets as a whole had a very successful month.

Amongst many small improvements to AtomicHub, we have invested a lot of time into improving our infrastructure to handle the quickly increasing demand. This includes improving our AtomicAssets API cluster, improving the AtomicAssets API code to make it more efficient, improving the node infrastructure as mentioned above, and strengthening the backend we use for handling captcha drops (primary sales) on AtomicHub.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?**

- We worked with Colonize Mars on their pack launch
- We worked with Metaforce on their pack launch
- We worked with ArtVndngMchn on their pack launch We worked with R2 and the EOS Amsterdam team on the Mutant Rockers collection as well as the Graffiti Kings collection
    
    (Points should fully go to Amsterdam if they also mention this in their report, they manage the project, we just handle the tech)
    

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

We have brought in two more members into our support team, so we now have 4 people working on collection whitelistings and general support.

We'd like to bring up that this might be considered as a product, since a lot of different projects rely on our whitelistings and verifications (e.g. WAX Cloud Wallet, TokenHead, R-Planet).

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

No updates

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

Both AtomicAssets as a whole and AtomicHub had by far their biggest month yet.

We made major efficiency improvements for the AtomicAssets API and scaled our infrastructure to deal with the growing demand.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

We've brought a dedicated marketing person on to our team a few days ago, so our marketing efforts will ramp up significantly from now on. We've also brought in an additional member to help with the general support requests that we receive.

## March 2021

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

We host the AtomicAssets API, which probably is rather unsurprising, but I just want to mention it because it now gives a point.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

The AtomicAssets ecosystem is doing fantastic and is experiencing high growth.

We have big plans to improve both AtomicHub and the AtomicAssets ecosystem, and are spending a lot of energy on hiring developers to speed up the process.

We are currently testing a system that allows us to use Coinbase Commerce to accept Bitcoin / Ethereum and some other crypto currencies for drops (primary sales) on AtomicHub, which we believe could help projects to broaden their customer base.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?**

- We worked with Bitcoin Origins to launch their Moment 4 blocks (packs)
- We worked with Splinterlands to let their users bridge their NFTs to AtomicAssets as well as on a pack sale directly on AtomicHub
- We're working on a multitude of new launches which will take place over the next month or two, some with established teams, and some with new teams entering the ecosystem.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

We've brought in two people to help us deal with the influx of support queries and whitelisting / verification requests.

We updated our nodes to include the security patches of 2.0.9**Product Development**

The AtomicAssets ecosystem is continuing to grow, as well as AtomicHub usage.

We have had to make multiple fixes to the AtomicAssets API to keep up with the increased amounts of transactions, and will roll out the major update that we have already worked on last month in the coming weeks.

**Ecosystem Development**- We worked with the "The Horrors" team to launch a new pack collection which sold out quickly and was well received by the community

- We are working on a special box (a pack containing packs) and an upgrade mechanic for HodlGod.We agreed to pack deals with two new projects and are in contact with multiple others

## December 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

No updates.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

Lots of new projects are launched on AtomicAssets, as well as new content being created by existing collections. AtomicHub usage has grown considerably over the last month and AtomicMarket is experiencing new market volume records.

We are continuing to improve both AtomicHub and the whole AtomicAssets tech stack, notably we are working on a major update for the AtomicAssets API to better handle surges in transactions and provide more detailed data on NFT burns.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?**

- We worked on the Blockchain Heroes Series 2 launch, which was well received by the community and included multiple different NFT packs in multiple phases, some of them using premints. We also already launched one upgrade mechanic with 2 more planned for December and January.
- We worked on the Monsters of Rap launch.
- We are working on the HodlGod launch, which will take place on Dec 21st

No updates

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

AtomicHub has again had more than 10,000 unique visitors last month, and AtomicAssets has breached the 1,000,000 NFT mark. Among lots of small changes and new features, AtomicHub now supports auctions and bundle sales for NFTs.

We have open sourced the AtomicPacks smart contract, which allows anyone to create their own NFT packs. It has already been used for the KOGs and GPK Crash Gordon packs in the past and we plan to build an interface for setting up packs on AtomicHub.

[https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicpacks-contract](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicpacks-contract)

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?**

Uplift.Art launched on November 15th and was the first ever NFT drop to use the pre mint pack system for random mint numbers. It also had two separate upgrade mechanics that we believe we will see in some capacity in many of the NFT launches in the future.

We worked together with the Blockchain Heroes team to create the "Advanced Enchanting" upgrade mechanic and will partner with them for the next major Blockchain Heroes launch.

The Mutant Warriors launch that we worked on went smoothly without any technical issues.

We have closed a deal with a new company that plans to launch multiple NFT collections in the future.

## October 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

AtomicHub has surpassed 10,000 unique users in the last month. We have brought a new member on our team to help us with the AtomicHub frontend. We are continuing to work hard on adding value to the AtomicAssets ecosystem, e.g. by improving our API and recently adding GraphQL support to it, and by developing a smart contract allowing pack openings with pre minted NFTs which will be used for the first time in the November.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Business Development?**

We are working with the uplift.art team on creating a first of its kind pack event on November 15th. It will feature random mints and unique upgrade mechanics.

We have worked on creating the "Forge" upgrade mechanic for Blockchain Heroes that launched on October 21st.

We have set up a market promotion for KOGs to encourage active trading which still is active at the time of writing this.We are also working together with EOS Amsterdam and R2 to make the Mutant Warriors launch on October 31st happen. On this project, EOS Amsterdam is taking the actual business development role though whereas we focus on the tech, therefore they should get all the points for this deal / engagement.

## September 2020

These are the updates for the OIG 2.0 rating for pink.network:

**Technical Operations**

We provide a snapshot service on

[https://snapshots.pink.gg/wax/mainnet](https://snapshots.pink.gg/wax/mainnet)

This is not new, however now that it has become an individual criterion we want to point it out.**Product Development**

AtomicHub is doing very well, with more than 6,000 unique visitors during the
last month. AtomicMarket has handled more than 10 million WAX worth of
sales during the last month.

We are continuing to improve the
AtomicAssets ecosystem daily, especially focusing on the pack creator
and mint on demand system that we got a WAX Labs project approved for,
and also making countless improvements to AtomicHub.

Reworking [stats.wax.gg](http://stats.wax.gg/) is still on our todo list, however for the time being it still works and got around 500 unique visitors during the last month.

**Business Development**As mentioned in last month's update, we have worked with uplift.art,
creating a new unique auction system for NFTs. We have advised them
throughout the whole process, and built the smart contract for them. The event has been a success, bringing in more than 200,000 WAX for the
charity uplift.nation. We are already working on a series 2 event that
will be bigger in scale and should attract larger audiences. We would
want this deal to be scored rather than the current "Company using
AtomicAssets" deal.

The "Company using AtomicAssets" deal is
still going very strong, however it will likely still take 3-6 months
before it can be made public.

We are continuing to work closely together with the Blockchain Heroes team, helping them
with airdrops and building new functionality such as the "Vortex" that
allowed users to burn 100 common NFTs to receive a special new NFT back.

On top of that, we are talking with multiple new projects about helping
them launch their NFT collections on WAX. We have already agreed on a
deal with one of these projects, and will likely agree to at least one
more deal in the near future. These projects have ambitions to bring in
new people, build new NFT mechanisms and use them in markets that have
the possibility of bringing in people entirely new to blockchain. We
will provide more details in coming updates as these deals progress.

## August 2020

**Technical Operations**

No updates

**Product Development**

AtomicAssets / AtomicMarket and AtomicHub have been hugely successful. We have seen more than 5,000 unique visitors on AtomicHub during the last month, and the AtomicMarket has handled more than 5 million WAX in volume. We are working hard to build on this success, both pushing forward the open source API and the AtomicHub site. We're also working on multiple solutions for AtomicAssets (including a Pack Opening smart contract and a smart contract for primary sales of NFTs) that we will make open source once they are done.

[stats.wax.gg](http://stats.wax.gg/) continues to be well received by the community, and we are planning a major update to it to improve performance.

**Business Development**

We are still in active contact with the big project that plans to use AtomicAssets. They are aiming for a first release in 6 months, and have assembled a very high profile team.

We are working together with Chibis Global, a project that recently sold more than $5,000 worth of NFTs in a pre sale, which have already tripled in value on the secondary market. Chibis already existed on Ethereum in the past, and we have worked with Yespa, showing him the advantages of using WAX and AtomicAssets and are giving him guidance on how to best make use of the unique advantages this brings.

For more than 2 months, we have also worked together with the uplift.nation team on uplift.art. Uplift.art is using NFTs to raise money for their charity, and have brought the first full length music video on the blockchain, specifically for this purpose. They will launch later this month and plan to also specifically target people from the Ethereum ecosystem, bringing them into WAX.

On top of that, we are also working closely with both the Blockchain Heroes and the KOGs teams. For BCH we have worked on making airdrops happen (including the Atomic Adam drop) and are now also developing a custom solution for them that will allow "upgrading" 100 common cards into one special card. For KOGs, we are handling both the primary sale and the pack opening smart contract for them, as well as advising them throughout the whole process.

**Community and Marketing**

We have played a crucial role in facilitating the "Atomic Adam" drop. This was the first time Topps Digital ever did a cross-promotion, and made headlines outside of the WAX ecosystem as well. e.g.

[http://gpknews.com/2020/08/topps-partners-with-blockchain-heroes-for-exclusive-digital-atomic-adam-card/](http://gpknews.com/2020/08/topps-partners-with-blockchain-heroes-for-exclusive-digital-atomic-adam-card/)

[https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-heroes-refuse-to-accept-old-world-fiat-payments](https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-heroes-refuse-to-accept-old-world-fiat-payments)

We have also run a marketing campaign in collaboration with Blockchain Heroes, creating a custom drop system that rewarded users for their active participation in the secondary market ([https://heroes.atomichub.io/giveaway/bcheroes](https://heroes.atomichub.io/giveaway/bcheroes)). This promotion has been very well received, and some of the cards given out have sold for $50-$110 on the secondary market, showing that this promotion created significant value.

## July 2020

These are the updates for the OIG 1.8 rating for pink.network:

**Technical Operations**

No Updates

**Product Development**

We launched AtomicAssets 1.0 and AtomicMarket 1.0 together with the AtomicHub.

AtomicAssets is a new NFT standard that we believe to have significant advantages over existing NFT standards.The AtomicAssets smart contract ([https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contract](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contract)) is heavily tested ([https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contract-tests](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contract-tests)) and documented.The AtomicMarket is a marketplace that builds on top of AtomicAssets and has a decentralized fee structure, meaning that it is suitable for any website or app to integrate and receive the full fees. This created an open ecosystem of different marketplaces sharing the same liquidity pool.The AtomicMarket smart contract ([https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicmarket-contract](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicmarket-contract)) also is heavily tested ([https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicmarket-contract-tests](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicmarket-contract-tests)) and documented.On top of the smart contracts, we have also built extremely powerful and open source developer tools to integrate AtomicAssets easily. This includes APIs for both AtomicAssets ([https://wax.api.atomicassets.io/atomicassets/docs/](https://wax.api.atomicassets.io/atomicassets/docs/)) and the AtomicMarket ([https://wax.api.atomicassets.io/atomicmarket/docs/](https://wax.api.atomicassets.io/atomicmarket/docs/)), which are based upon the eosio-contract-api ([https://github.com/pinknetworkx/eosio-contract-api](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/eosio-contract-api)).We also built a javascript module [https://github.com/pinknetworkx/pinknetworkjs](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/pinknetworkjs)The AtomicHub is a website which makes all the features of AtomicAssets available to users in an intuitive interface. It includes an explorer, a marketplace, a trading interface and an NFT creator which anyone can use to create their own NFTs, without requiring any programming knowledge.The launch of the AtomicHub has been a great success, with more than 800 unique users visiting it within the first week, more than 7,000 NFTs being created through the NFT creator, and already more than 20 high quality collections having been verified by us.The AtomicHub is currently exclusive to WAX.For this rating, we want to have the following 3 products be rated:- [stats.wax.gg](http://stats.wax.gg/)- AtomicAssets and AtomicMarket smart contracts and dev ecosystem- AtomicHub ([wax.atomichub.io](http://wax.atomichub.io/))**Business Development**Multiple developers and organisations have reached out to us after the AtomicAssets / AtomicHub launch, planning to build dapps using AtomicAssets. We are in conversations with them, but none of them went far enough for us to count this as a deal for the category.Conversations with the big partner mentioned in the last report are still very active and progressing nicely.**Community and Marketing**We are operating [guide.wax.gg](http://guide.wax.gg/), an interactive collection of more than 30 original guides created by us. We keep making changes to it to keep it up to date.We are also operating an account creator ([create.wax.gg](http://create.wax.gg/)) and an avatar service ([photo.wax.gg](http://photo.wax.gg/)), which we view as community tools.Both Fabian and me (Jona) are very active in Telegram, and I (once again, Jona) moderate the WAX main channel, the WAX Talk channel and the GPK Trading channel.

## June 2020

pink.network guild updates of the last month:

**Technical Operations**

No updates

**Product Development**

Instead of the decentralized bankroll, we would like to submit the smaller services of [wax.gg](http://wax.gg/) as one combined product, most importantly the Photo service and the account creator.

The account creator has seen a lot of activity especially, with over 400 unique reported users visiting the site and 279 accounts being created in the last month. We believe that this has been a crucial factor in onboarding new people to the WAX blockchain, especially those that were attracted by the GPK launch.The photo service has been integrated in the WAX cloud wallet. Almost 700 unique reported users have visited the site in the last month and more than 160 accounts have so far used it to set an avatar.**Business Development**

We are in active conversations with multiple entities that are interested in using the AtomicAssets NFT standard.

The following information is only meant for IGs and not to be shared publicly:

One of these conversations has already progressed very far, to the point where there is a medium sized team actively working on the project, and us advising them and offering technical expertise.

This project is aiming to establish an NFT art business. We can't share more details at this time, but the project has very high ambitions and significant funding. It has the potential to make a major impact on the NFT art scene and on WAX.

**Community Engagement**

We believe that the guides on [https://guide.wax.gg/](https://guide.wax.gg/) add way more value than just the sum of the word counts. The articles are relatively short on purpose, because they are meant to serve as a sort of encyclopedia where specific details about WAX can be looked at. Still though, there are more than 6000 words in total. We could now stretch out the content and add articles that nobody needs anyways, but that we can talk a lot about, or translate everything into German which nobody will read. But that does not add any value.Going by the Note in the guidelines saying "Each IG may also decide to award points to content outside of these minimums based on other factors, such as quality and reach", we therefore think that receiving points for our content is warranted, even though we did not write 1500 words in the last month.**Feedback**- We believe that the word count / video length requirements should be dropped entirely. They promote unnecessarily stretched out content.- We believe that the points for Hyperion should be monitored more closely. Hyperion nodes with inconsistent data or those that only have a low uptime do not add a lot of value, because they can't be relied on.- We believe that it can make sense to have more than 3 products that can be rated. As a requirement for making this work without it being possible to abuse this by only building a lot of small features, the individual points for products need to be adjusted so that high quality products are rated adequately in comparison to smaller products

- **Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**We believe that there needs to be a better, more interactive way to give feedback to the IGs. We keep writing feedback in here every month and never hear if that feedback is being considered and what the thoughts of the IGs are. As already discussed in the telegram group, a sort of ticketing system could be a good solution.

- **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development criteria? Please provide details.**-
- **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Business Development criteria? Please provide details.**We are in active conversations with 3 different teams regarding the implementation of AtomicAssets in their upcoming games / dapps. As those projects aren't publicly announced yet, we can't share more details at this moment.
- **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement criteria? Please provide details.**As part of an online WAX meetup together with Michael from MaltaBlock and Ross from EOSphere, I (Jona) presented our upcoming NFT standard AtomicAssets. I talked about its advantages, our process of building a hub for it, and answered questions that the community could ask in the live chat.[https://www.crowdcast.io/e/wax-blockchain-meetup-4](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/wax-blockchain-meetup-4)
- **Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**We still stand behind the feedback that we gave last month, most importantly that there should be more differentiation between "just" decent and very good products.

## March 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

We do not have any updates regarding technical operations.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

We would like to enter the following 3 products for the product development category:

- [stats.wax.gg](http://stats.wax.gg/) / With around 1,000 monthly active users, our stats page is probably one of the most well used sites in the WAX ecosystem and displays WAX specific stats about the blockchain and the dapps on it.

- Decentralized Bankroll Service / ([https://pink.network/bankroll](https://pink.network/bankroll)) The decentralized bankroll service utilizes the WAX RNG oracle to provide provably fair bets that any developer can access to implement in their dapp. It is fully open source ([https://github.com/pinknetworkx/bankroll-dapp](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/bankroll-dapp))

- AtomicAssets / ([https://atomicassets.io/](https://atomicassets.io/)) AtomicAssets is a new NFT standard that we are developing that we believe to be significantly superior over any existing NFT standards. The beta is already fully functional, which is why we believe it is adequate to rate it at 2 points and not 1. AtomicAssets is fully open source ([https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contracts](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contracts)).

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Business Development?**

We are in contact with the Karma team and are discussing the possibilities that integrating NFTs into their social media platform could bring them and have already discussed various options for that. We feel like this falls in the category "Rate 1 + followup meetings. Or at least one confirmed meetings with business/exchange/dapp" worth 2 points.

In the context of AtomicAssets, we are also working on a marketplace for the AtomicAssets NFTs. It is unclear to us whether this falls in the "Managing an exchange integration with WAX" criteria.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

Less than two months ago, we released [https://guide.wax.gg/](https://guide.wax.gg/), which features over 30 articles, 100% created by us. Both Fabian and me (Jona) are also very active on Telegram, which is evident given that I was chosen as one of only 5 WAXPerts in the official WAX telegram channel.

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

## February 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

-

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

We planned, developed and announced AtomicAssets (https://atomicassets.io/), a new NFT standard. Across our team, we estimate that around 300 hours of work were spent on planning, prototyping, developing and documenting.

Both the smart contract (https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contracts) and the javascript module (https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-js) are published under an open source license.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Geographic Distribution?**

On top of our nodes in Germany and Finland, we now have a 3rd node in France.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Business Development?**

We are in contact with multiple businesses, talking about a possible integration of AtomicAssets on WAX in their products

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

We think it would be a good idea to also add more gradual grading for community engagement. We realize that this its difficult to grade 100% objectively, however we believe that those that put a lot of effort into helping the community, especially by creating educational material, should be rewarded accordingly.

We also think that the geographic distribution points still need to be improved, or perhaps removed if no adequate solution is found. While in general we understand the value of having nodes distributed in a lot of different countries, this system can very easily be played.

First of all, it is difficult to verify if the locations that guilds name are correct at all.

Secondly, guilds that do not already receive points for geographic distribution are encouraged to rent cheap servers in small countries and run a node there only to receive the points.

Thirdly, guilds could rent cheap servers in countries that "competitor" guilds already host their nodes in, and thus bring the total amount of nodes over 3 for that country in an attempt to take away points from other guilds.

There has been a lot of discussion about this in the Telegram chat, and as far as we're aware, no good solution has been found (and we can't think of one either). Therefore, the best way might be to remove those points altogether.

The third thing that we believe might be a good idea would be to include a short list of bullet points for each of the non-trivial points awarded in the OIG report, explaining why the respective points were awarded for a guild. We believe this would significantly improve transparency.

## January 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

We are currently working on creating a new NFT Asset standard. We have already got a fully functional beta version of the smart contract as well as a functional javascript library. You should most likely see our official announcement for that within the coming month.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Geographic Distribution?**

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

We have launched [https://guide.wax.gg/](https://guide.wax.gg/) It is an interactive collection of more than 30 individual guides that we created that cover all major aspects of WAX. We created it with the main goal of providing a single, high quality source for all common questions that people interested in WAX might have. We specifically designed it in a way that would allow it to easily share specific guides, which makes it much easier to answer common questions on social platforms (eg Telegram), where people can now just send the links to our guides instead of answering the question over and over again.

Our dedicated servers are located in secured datacenters operated by OVH.https://us.ovhcloud.com/about/company/security

### Please provide information regarding projects that your Guild is working on to improve the WAX ecosystem. Information about plans, progress, and timelines is helpful. This includes projects that have been submitted for the WAX Guild Showcase program

The first project we started working on was a decentralized bankroll (https://pink.network/bankroll). It allows developers to built gambling applications risk-free, and offers the end users a trustless gambling experience secured by the official WAX RNG oracle. The bankroll comes with a well documented and feature-rich API (https://pink.network/documentation) that makes working with the blockchain significantly easier for developers. We also built an own gambling site on top of our bankroll (https://betpink.gg/) that so far has had a volume of 1.6 million wax.We took part in the $25,000 #BuildOnWax challenge with this project and won the 1st place.Since then we have added an 2nd gamemode to betpink.gg and started working on our suite of WAX microservices (https://wax.gg/). Among an account creator and a service that allows users to link a photo to their WAX account, our most prominent microservice is https://stats.wax.gg/ . On there we display a range of WAX specific statistics that have previously been very difficult to find. We have multiple big updates planned for the stats site, as we also outlined in our recently submitted SMART goal.In the near future, we will be focusing on further improving our existing microservices, as well implementing new ones. Along with that, we will assist any 3rd party developers that want to build their own applications on top of our decentralized bankroll. As a mid-to-long term goal we are also working on a NFT-based browser game that we believe has a realistic chance of bringing hundreds of crypto game enthusiasts on the WAX blockchain (https://pink.network/guild#nft-game-sneak-peak).

### Please state the jurisdiction your Guild is domiciled in, as well as the jurisdiction that your Guild's nodes are deployed in.

Germany

### Please share any usage metrics you have, if any. This includes data specific to applications and user activity driven to the WAX ecosystem as a result of your Guild's efforts.

212 unique users on our sites last 7 days (114 on stats.wax.gg)14,939,049 requests to our full history node last week44,758,959 requests to our full history node last month1.6 million WAX wagered on betpink.gg (most used WAX dapp)

### If possible, please share information about businesses that your Guild is engaging with that are seeking to learn about and leverage the WAX ecosystem in some way.

We provided a non-limited full history node to [dappradar.com](http://dappradar.com/), who plan to add WAX dapps to their site in December.

### Please share any information regarding community building efforts championed by your Guild. This can be facilitating translation of documentation, organizing meetups, and otherwise driving social and human engagement within the platform.

The microservices we have built on [https://wax.gg/](https://wax.gg/) all directly benefit the community. This is especially true for the account creator service, which allows those new to WAX to create their account quickly and easily without having to enter any of their private information. We are also active in the official WAX telegram channel, where we often help by giving technical insights.

### Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

While we believe that it is good to have clear guidelines for the guilds, we think that there should be a more nuanced evaluation of some of the criteria. While some of the points can clearly only be true or false (e.g. "Hyperion API node available"), others aren't as clear cut (e.g. "Builds useful software tools and services" or Community Engagement in general). We believe that this encourages guilds to build lower quality products / services / content just in order to "check the boxes".
