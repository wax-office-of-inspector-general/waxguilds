### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
We faced issues with our full history Hyperion, causing us to have to switch to partial hyperion while we work on fixing missing transactions. We developed multiple new products during this period, such as Qaraqol Metrics. We also developed and open sourced two different tools related to Hyperion.

Hyperion Tools:

**URLs**: 
https://github.com/qaraqol/hyperion-repair-helper
https://github.com/qaraqol/hyperion-actions-metrics

**Update**: We developed and open sourced two tools regarding hyperion. First is the Hyperion Actions tool, allowing anyone to track and compare the daily number of actions processed by Hyperion nodes on the WAX blockchain. 

The second tool is the Hyperion repair helper, designed to reindex blocks that are either missing entirely or simply missing transactions over and over again automatically in small batches, reducing the load on the server and making the default repair script easier to use.

Qaraqol Metrics:

**URLs**:
https://metrics.qaraqol.com/
**List of SCs**:  N/A

**Update**: During the past evaluation period, we developed a tool to track and visualize historical data regarding resource cost and the correlation with transaction per second. Short term plan is to track different types of data on WAX, and develop an API for developers to be able to get the WAX Staked: x Resource Ratio.
