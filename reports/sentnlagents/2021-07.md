Sentnl

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

* Our Hyperion setup went down again due to lack of diskspace, so we have insalled a new server with 14TB of NVME disks, which should hopefully keep us going for a few more months. I still syncing, hence Hyperion not working at present. 

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?


### 1. Security Audits

We continue to perform security audits for Guilds on the WAX mainchain.
We have now completed  all the security scans for guilds and will be starting back from the beginning. 

*  We completed another security scan of  BlokCrafters, Wizardsguild.
*  We are in the process of performing a smart contract audit for Onsessus. 



#### Milestones for the following month:

1.  Complete another 2 Pentesting scans for Guilds.



### 2. Automated Guild Rating system


#### Better context on guild page:

*  We added a new column to DB to associate a guild with an account name, to allow Guilds to login. 
*  When a guild logs in, profile page points to Guildpage and displays "This is your guild"
*  Additional functioning can be added in future.

### Other Frontendchanges
- Fix the display of inactive or blank guilds
- Change producers query to show inactive
- Deactivate guild query (guild name) (already done!)
- Add new guild query (only owner name and URL)
- Add database column called account name
- Add "profile" to navbar when logged in
- Fix the issue where /guilds/XYZ didn't show up when directly linked on the deployed site
- Set min score to 130 (frontend only)
-  Query to edit or add account_name  
- Include atomic_api across the app  
- Update db-start to include atomic_api  
- Exclude retired guilds from showing up in places they shouldn't.

### Other Backend changes
- Added additional hyperion check - checks that total indexed matches last indexed blocks within range of 10 to acccount for Hyperion machines not fully indexed.

#### Milestones for the following month:

- **2 Tech rsults results per day**  - We are working on a SQL query to pull down tech results but limits these to, two per day.
- **Retired guilds button** at the bottom, with retired guilds popping down below it.
- **Form to add new guilds via admin page**. The fastify function is done however we still need to update the frontend for OIG admins.
- **Scaffolding to allow admins to tweak min scores** - Create option for OIG to set the minimum score to pass as guild. 
- **Add minimum requirement field to technical checks** - Some technical checks have become minimum requirements  so the backend python needs to be updated to automatically fail a Guild if one of those checks fail.
- **Create docker environmen for autorollout** - Create two dockerfiles, one for frontend and another for DB. This will allow frontend to be updated without effecting backend DB container. 
- **Future updates** - Work on a update script that can be provided to allow easy updating of a running WAX oig portal instance. 


### 3. Automated snapshot Service

### 5. OIG tech monitoring API

### 6. Sentnl CVE search API.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

no changes.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

**Performing live hacks & Educating WAX community around security**:


**Creation of original informational content or translation that benefits WAX:**

Sentnl Security Wiki  - https://wiki.sentnl.io

We have added an additonal CVE query example showing how to search for any vulnerabilities that macth your wordpress install - https://wiki.sentnl.io/security/cve-query-api-examples/wordpress-+-plugins-cve-query



**Contract audits API for exchanges**

Part of our business we also provide smart contract audits for DAPPs on EOSIO chains, working with some block explorers we identified a need to provide an API service, which block explorers or exchanges can query to validate whether the contracts loaded on chain have been audited, by comparing the on chain sha256 hash vs sha256 hash stated on our API.

Once we complete the audit we compile the contracts based on the code we audited and that hash is saved on the certificate and our API, which can then be compared to the loaded contracts.

This can be queried via - https://www.sentnl.io/api/tokens

Now that WAX is opening up its chain to DeFi, I think this will become a very useful service for token holders to be able to verify the security of Defi DAPPS.
