Sentnl

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

* Our Hyperion is back up and running now. 
* We created a new monitoring tool called EOSmonitor for our block producers. It monitors the following and alerts if there are any issues:
- The amount of P2P connections to your node, if less than 5 alert.
- If an Unlinkable block is detected, you will be alerted.
- If an Fork is detected,  you will be alerted.
- If a Dropped block is detected, you will be alerted.
- If a your producer misses a block, you will be alerted. The iphpone allows a setting which overides your phones silent settings, which we have configured if our producer misses a block.


We release this as a tool also, but we would like to monitor its performance over the next month.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?


### 1. Security Audits

We continue to perform security audits for Guilds on the WAX mainchain.
We have now completed  all the security scans for guilds and will be starting back from the beginning. 

*  We completed a security scan of Sentnl for once. 
*  We are in the process of completing the Telos ETH EVM audit. During which we found a zero day exploit on ETH. Cannot provide more details, but further details will come out on Tuesday.



#### Milestones for the following month:

1.  Complete another 2 Pentesting scans for Guilds.



### 2. Automated Guild Rating system


#### Better context on guild page:


## FASTIFY:
- Addition of updateProducer method (accepting both active state and account_name changes)
- Addition of "account_name" when adding a guild

## ADD NEW GUILD DIALOG:

- Accepts guild_name, url, and account_name (latter optional) as params

- Guild settings table. Shows the following:
    - guild_name (owner_name, uneditable - different name chosen to help differentiate it from account_name)
    - account_name (editable), and 
    - active state (i.e. retired or not)
- Active state can be easily switched with a click of an eye icon.
- I chose this since I thought it would be annoying to type true/false
- A button for changing what table is visible a la Latest Results page
- Note: I tried to get tableData to update via hooks, but it seems I'm limited by material-table - it doesn't like data mutations

**Allow OIG to set Minimum Tech Score**

- Create admin settings table to hold admin settings (only minimum tech score for now)
- Fastify functions to read and update admin settings
- Form to display and edit minimum score
- Guilds page relies on minimum score from DB

- New security calculation
- Atomic API check & logo & dynamic coloring
- Tooltip that shows failed parts of the security test.
- Tooltip doesn't show at all if all tests succeeded.

## TryUpdateTable/UpdateDB
- Fastify connection for new guild functions (creation/updating)
- A function allowing different data to be passed to state vs. db. It's used in the creation of new guilds - their URL is passed through to the database, but the front-end table just shows the guild_name, account_name, and active state. 

## Backend

- Added minimum requirement field to technical checks
- Create docker environmen for autorollout - Create two dockerfiles, one for frontend and another for DB. This will allow frontend to be updated without effecting backend DB container. 
- Created update script to allow for easy updating of running WAX portal instance

#### Milestones for the following month:

- **2 Tech results results per day**  - We are working on a SQL query to pull down tech results but limits these to, two per day. 
- **Future updates** - Continue working on a update script that can be provided to allow easy updating of a running WAX oig portal instance. 


### 3. Automated snapshot Service

We updated the urlib library as there was a high severity vulnerabilty.


**Creation of original informational content or translation that benefits WAX:**

Sentnl Security Wiki  - https://wiki.sentnl.io

We are working on an additonal CVE query example showing how to search for any vulnerabilities that match an Atomic API install, but we are not qute there yet. Watch this space. 


We have posted our monthly update to Medium and tweeted our update to all our followers, here is the link:
