## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

* We performed variouos security updates on all our react-js instances running our various operations.
* We are working on a wesite refresh. Got a good designer to help us out.
* We have installed Atomi-API and got it all synced up, thanks to a DB copy from Pink.gg -  http://atomic.sentnl.io


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?


### 1. Security Audits

We continue to perform security audits for Guilds on the WAX mainchain.
We have now completed  all the security scans for guilds and will be starting back from the beginning. 

*  We completed a security scan of EOSarabia.net & Pink.gg this month.
*  Last month during a EVM audit we discovered a GETH bug - https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-9856-9gg9-qcmq



#### Milestones for the following month:

1.  Complete another 2 Pentesting scans for Guilds.



### 2. Automated Guild Rating system

## Frontend

1. Top 21 guilds are now visually highlighted on the Latest Results page.

2. Scores are now editable, placed for easy access alongside comments, and typo-proof to prevent losing progress if mass-adjusting scores.

3. Monthly average result being polished off - scores and CPU times are shown as averages, while boolean checks (e.g. atomic_api) are shown as percentage true / percentage uptime.

4. Progress being made on a "Wayback Machine" / Meta Snapshot system whereby the entire OIG Portal can be frozen in time and scrolled back on at any time - with all products, bizdevs, tech scores, total scores, comments, and the like being locked, so that it's easy to go back and check how the guilds were doing at a certain time. Backend functionality development has begun, and frontend design is underway.
 

## Backend

- Complete the "Wayback Machine" functionality.

#### Milestones for the following month:

- **2 Tech results results per day**  - We are working on a SQL query to pull down tech results but limits these to, two per day. 
- **Future updates** - Continue working on a update script that can be provided to allow easy updating of a running WAX oig portal instance. 


### 3. Automated snapshot Service


### 4. EOSmonitor

EOSmonitor has now been released.

Next month we will be looking to change the configuration to allow a user to set which alerts they would like to receive.


**Creation of original informational content or translation that benefits WAX:**

Sentnl Security Wiki  - https://wiki.sentnl.io

We are working on an additonal CVE query example showing how to search for any vulnerabilities that match an Atomic API install, but we are not quite there yet. 


We have posted our monthly update to Medium and tweeted our update to all our followers, here is the link:

## Rate limits ##

We only apply rate limits on our hyperion servers using hapoxy as per following:


# Store source IPs in table 
stick-table type ip size 200k expire 30s store  gpc0,conn_rate(10s),http_req_rate(10s)

  # IPs that have ben flagged with gt than gpc0  are blocked, until no requests are send for 30 seconds. 
acl source_is_abuser src_get_gpc0 gt 0

# If more than 100 requests are send within 10 seconds, gets blocked for 30 seconds.
acl conn_rate_abuse  sc1_conn_rate gt 100
acl mark_as_abuser   sc1_inc_gpc0  ge 0
