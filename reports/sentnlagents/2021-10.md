## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

* We had a problem with our automatic failureover this month, so have been testing this in the background. Realised our issue was operational in that we did not update IP addresses after making a change on a server.
* We have hired a new fulltime frontend Developer that will help us push out the OIG-portal muchg faster now.

  # IPs that have ben flagged with gt than gpc0  are blocked, until no requests are send for 30 seconds.
