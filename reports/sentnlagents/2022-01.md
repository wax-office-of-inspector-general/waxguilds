## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?


### 1. Security Audits

- We have started researching an additional paid for service to add to our arsenal - Tenable.io We are currently evaluating 3 of their products to asses which one works best. We noticed one particular security flaw in nginx was only found by these products, so using their products will ensure our security checks encompass all current vulnerabilities.


- This month we completed a audit for EOSdetroit.



### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:

- Complete another 1 Guild security audit. 
- Complete tenable product assessments and start incorporating the checks.


### 2. Automated Guild Rating system

- **URL:** https://oig.sentnl.io 
- **Github:** https://github.com/ankh2054/oig-portal/


### Frontend

- Adjust average scores based on days. We now have a setting to allow the OIG to control of how many days the averages should be based on for each check. Default is 30 days.

- Time machine now fully working and state is carried across. Before when you clicked on refresh you would be removed from the timemachine state.

- Added none button to allow oig to disable timemachine.

### Backend

- **Adjust checks to only perform 1 request per second.** We noticed that many guilds were blocking our checks due to too many requests happening per second. 
- **Refresh nodes** We also introduced a new function that deletes all associated nodes for a guild upon each check to ensure old nodes are removed from the DB.

### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:

- **Filter homepage results based on the timemachine snapshot chosen.** This is the first step in allowing the OIG to publish the results directly on the site each month.
- **Start operational manual for the site.** Create WIKI like site that acts as an operational manual for the site. This will ensure we cover all the features of the site and help new OIG members get up to speed easier. 
- **Automatically pick up new guilds** Re-introduce the original setting that automatically  picks up new guilds. This has a few problems that will need to be worked through, due to older guilds not unreg'ing and various other code exceptions for dodgy guild setups. 



### 3. WAXRAM 

- **URL:** https://waxram.sentnl.io 
- **Github:** https://github.com/ankh2054/eos-ramdex

No updates this month.


## Running useful APIs:


### CVE search service

- **URL:**  https://vuln.sentnl.io
- **Github:** https://github.com/ankh2054/CVE-Search-Docker


### Atomic API

- We continue to provide the Atomic API service.

## Creation of original informational content or translation that benefits WAX:

**Sentnl Security Wiki  - https://wiki.sentnl.io**

* This month we created the CVE query for Atomic API

https://wiki.sentnl.io/security/cve-query-api-examples/atomic-api-cve-query

**NFT articles**

* This month we wrote about the new AMC spiderman NFT launch - https://medium.com/@charles.holtzkampf/amc-spiderman-nfts-f1a7ea7221f0
* We also wrote a article about the most expensive NFTs sold  -https://medium.com/@charles.holtzkampf/nfts-the-most-expensive-sold-in-2021-7dbd94c9a525
* We have also started discussing a partnership with https://lovenfts.io/, whom has plans to grow a huge following. He owns and runs one of the biggest retro gaming manufacturing companies in the UK and has a huge facebook following. We hope this partnership will bring a lot more users over to WAX.



We have posted our monthly update to Medium and tweeted our update to all our followers, here is the link:



## Community tools 

We wanted to just touch base on all the tools we have developed for the Guild community:

* Delphi oracle Docker - We created a docker image to easily allow new Guilds get setup with pushing pricing feeds to the oracle.  https://github.com/ankh2054/delphioracle

* Snapshot service Docker and automated website - We created a docker image and ReactJS frontend to automate the setup of a snapshot service for WAX mainnet and testnet.
https://github.com/ankh2054/snapshots.sentnl.io
https://github.com/ankh2054/snapshot-service

* EOS monitor - We created a EOS node monitoring tool that monitors your nodeos and alerts if if there any issues.

### Hyperion missing blocks feature (NEW RELEASE) - A script that automates finding missing blocks in hyperion.

https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api/tree/v3.3.5/scripts/fix_missing_blocks 

- We created a update to account for logfile changes in version 3.3.5. Our tool uses regex to search for the text that indicates no more blocks are being processed. The text in the log file differs between 3.1 and 3.3. We updated our code to allow the user to configure this first.
