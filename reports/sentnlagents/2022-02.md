## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

This month we completed the following within our technical environment. 

- We integrated nagios performance metrics into Grafana.
- We created a ansible playbook to install collectd to collect various performance metrics fro our servers and pass into Grafana
- We created a nagios script to crawl our eosio logfile
- We created a nagios script to monitor the amount of P2P connections for each of our nodes.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?


### 1. Security Audits

- We have started researching an additional paid for service to add to our arsenal - Tenable.io We are still evaluating 3 of their products to assess which one works best. 


- This month we completed an audit for EOSsweden.



### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:

- Complete another 1 Guild security audit. 
- Complete our tenable product assessments and start incorporating the checks.



### 2. Automated Guild Rating system

- **URL:** https://oig.sentnl.io 
- **Github:** https://github.com/ankh2054/oig-portal/


### Frontend

* Implemented various fixes this month:

- **filter on the scores page such that:** when in none, the tech results on scores page should be based on the latest results based on date for column snapshot_date AND when in metasnapshot, the tech results on scores page should be based on the metasnapshot_date column, based on the metasnapshot you are currently viewing.

- fixed a bug that caused **fastify server to crash** when you are viewing the guild page ---> click on timemachine --->choose None.



### Backend

- **Log outputs** -  made changes to how we log the output for better troubleshooting
- **Automatic adding of new guilds** - We have now implemented a function to automatically add new guilds from chain. The OIG can still disable guilds and the function will take this into account to not re-enable them when added from chain.
- **Frequency of script** - We changed the frequency of our backend script to only run every 45 mins, as before it as trying to run every 15mins and at times two processes were overlapping causing issues with empty nodes in the DB for some Guilds which in turn would be cause the Guilds to fail on those checks.

### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:

- Have call with OIG to identify next steps.



### 3.  OIG Wiki

- **URL:** https://docs.sentnl.io 
- **Github:** https://github.com/ankh2054/oig-portal/docs/


We have started the creation of a WIKI that acts as an operational manual for the site. This will ensure we cover all the features of the site and help new OIG members get up to speed easier.

### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:

- Add more Wiki content


### 4. WAXRAM 

- **URL:** https://waxram.sentnl.io 
- **Github:** https://github.com/ankh2054/eos-ramdex

No updates this month.

### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:

- Integrate some data from https://bdata.one to show more RAM related information.


## Running useful APIs:


### CVE search service

- **URL:**  https://vuln.sentnl.io
- **Github:** https://github.com/ankh2054/CVE-Search-Docker


### Atomic API

- We continue to provide the Atomic API service.

## Creation of original informational content or translation that benefits WAX:

**Sentnl Security Wiki  - https://wiki.sentnl.io**


**NFT articles**

This month we wrote articles about the AMC Spiderman NFTâ€™s, spiderman is very close to my heart as my eldest and youngest love him to bits.

## Community tools 

We wanted to just touch base on all the tools we have developed for the Guild community:

* Delphi oracle Docker - We created a docker image to easily allow new Guilds get setup with pushing pricing feeds to the oracle.  https://github.com/ankh2054/delphioracle

* Snapshot service Docker and automated website - We created a docker image and ReactJS frontend to automate the setup of a snapshot service for WAX mainnet and testnet.
https://github.com/ankh2054/snapshots.sentnl.io
https://github.com/ankh2054/snapshot-service

## EOS monitor - We created a EOS node monitoring tool that monitors your nodeos and alerts if if there any issues.

https://github.com/ankh2054/eosmonitor

**UPDATE** 

Made changes to automatically pick up the local hostname to pass into the REGEX when counting the amount of P2P connections using LSOF. Previously this was hardcoded and required an additional configuration step to make it work.

### Hyperion missing blocks feature - A script that automates finding missing blocks in hyperion.

https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api/tree/v3.3.5/scripts/fix_missing_blocks 


### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:

- Hyperion ansible install playbook 
- We are working on creating a ansible playbook to automatically install Hyperion and our aim is to have this available for testing during March.
