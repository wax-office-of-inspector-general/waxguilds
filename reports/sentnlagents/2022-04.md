## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?


### 1. Security Audits

- **Blockchain Brawlers:** We also perform a security audit for WAX, of their blockchain brawlers smart contract, the WAX NFT bridge and the JS backend. This was a paid for Job and arranged with Lukas Sliwka.
- **Tenable:** We have also decided against tenable.


### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:

### Backend

- Just added a few more try and except clauses, due to newer guilds causing crashes.


### Milestones for the following 2-3 months:


- We are looking at moving away from React to Django. This will allow for a better integration into the backend python and allow more control over when and how things can be run.

## Community tools 

We wanted to just touch base on all the tools we have developed for the Guild community:

* Delphi oracle Docker - We created a docker image to easily allow new Guilds get setup with pushing pricing feeds to the oracle.  https://github.com/ankh2054/delphioracle

* Snapshot service Docker and automated website - We created a docker image and ReactJS frontend to automate the setup of a snapshot service for WAX mainnet and testnet.

## EOS monitor - We created a EOS node monitoring tool that monitors your nodeos and alerts if if there any issues.

### Hyperion missing blocks feature - A script that automates finding missing blocks in hyperion.

https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api/tree/v3.3.5/scripts/fix_missing_blocks 

This month we updated the script to allow for multichain use, by adding a config option to set the Elastic index pattern.

https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api/pull/93



### Hyperion playbook

I've discussed wth Igor whether this would be a useful addition and he agreed that it would. The playbook is still private, but I have copied the main task to pastebin for reference.

https://pastebin.com/AZhr58nd

It requires a bit more testing and some variables need adding to allow for each guild to personalize the configuration more. I have tested this on various ubuntu installs and it works fine. 

### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:

- Doing more testing on the hyperion playbook and add more variables.
