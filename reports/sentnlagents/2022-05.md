## Community tools 

We wanted to just touch base on all the tools we have developed for the Guild community:

* Delphi oracle Docker - We created a docker image to easily allow new Guilds get setup with pushing pricing feeds to the oracle.  https://github.com/ankh2054/delphioracle

### Update to Delphi oracle Docker 

We have updated the tool to also include a python option to perform oracle updates. This includes a separate docker image to build and run the python option.

* Snapshot service Docker and automated website - We created a docker image and ReactJS frontend to automate the setup of a snapshot service for WAX mainnet and testnet.
