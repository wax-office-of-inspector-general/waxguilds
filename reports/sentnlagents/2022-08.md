## What did your guild do to help with the situation on wax.

We have been having some issues with our OIG monitoring system and how it reports our hyperion (that is another story), but we noticed our Delphiactions were failing and then investigating further we noticed that many guilds were failing. We checked the logs and saw that the transactions were been executed locally, but then expired before getting into a block. We then circumvented our usual route and send the transactions directly to our sentry node wiregaurd which made a slight difference. We are not entirely sure why this is, but as Aaron mentioned a very astute technical user could be setting very specific expiration times on a transaction so that it passes all the API and sentry nodes checks, only to fail when it hits the BP. All of these failed transactions are then clogging up the queue which causes others to fail, which is perhaps why sending the delphi oracle transactions directly to my sentry node made a slight difference as it reduced the latency getting to my BP.

## Community tools 

We wanted to just touch base on all the tools we have developed for the Guild community:

* Delphi oracle Docker - We created a docker image to easily allow new Guilds get setup with pushing pricing feeds to the oracle.  https://github.com/ankh2054/delphioracle

* Snapshot service Docker and automated website - We created a docker image and ReactJS frontend to automate the setup of a snapshot service for WAX mainnet and testnet.
