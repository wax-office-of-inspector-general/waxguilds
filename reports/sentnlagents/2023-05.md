## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Introduce two new tools.

### 1. Security Audits

- **Security Audit:** 

This month, we initiated the development of a platform called Sengine, which enables Guilds to conduct their own penetration testing. We are currently working on both the backend and frontend components. The following is a brief demo (note that the frontend is still under development and will have a polished appearance upon completion).


**The current workflow is as following**

- A Guild logs in using the Anchor wallet.
- The Guild adds domains they wish to scan.
- The Guild selects a domain to scan.
- After completing the scan, vulnerabilities associated with all discovered subdomains are listed.


**Current tools and vulnerabilities checked for.**

- Subfinder, gawk: Identify all subdomains associated with a domain.
- Nuclei: Features thousands of templates for scanning various protocols (TCP, DNS, HTTP, SSL, File, Whois, Websocket, Headless, etc.) to detect vulnerabilities.
- Additional tools, such as httpx, nmap, naabu, and chrome headless browser, are integrated to streamline the process.

**Future tools anbd vulnerability checks to be integrated:**

- Git check: Implement a range of tools to examine GitHub repositories and commit histories, identifying sensitive information or secrets that should not be present.
- XSS check: Integrate an extensive set of tools and tests to detect and evaluate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- WAX Software: Incorporate customized scripts to assess potential security flaws in tools frequently used within the WAX community, including Atomic API, Hyperion, and others.
- SSH audit: Employ a variety of tools to test and audit SSH ports for weaknesses (banner, key exchange, encryption, mac, compression, compatibility, security, etc).

As the product evolves, this list will expand. The goal is to closely replicate our manual audits for a comprehensive security assessment.

Here is an image of the python celery worker working it's way throgh the various tools to scan each subdomain.

Here is a video of the frontend mechanics. (againt it's very basic, but it shows the workflow). We are still working on adding the vulnerabilities page to list all of the vulnerabilities that are saved for each scan from the database.

### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:

- Complete another 1 security audits. 
- Continue workig on our MVP - Sengine

### Frontend

* We are working on a new frontend, here is a rough home page redesign as an example.

### Backend

* We've integrated FastAPI to enable individual guilds to request on-demand scans from our frontend, allowing them to instantly verify their stats without waiting for scheduled scans.

https://github.com/ankh2054/oig-portal/blob/master/backend/main.py

### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:

* Continue working on our new react frontend.

## Creation of original informational content or translation that benefits WAX:

**Sentnl Security Wiki  - https://wiki.sentnl.io**



## Community tools 

We wanted to just touch base on all the tools we have developed for the Guild community:

* Delphi oracle Docker - We created a docker image to easily allow new Guilds get setup with pushing pricing feeds to the oracle.  https://github.com/ankh2054/delphioracle

* Snapshot service Docker and automated website - We created a docker image and ReactJS frontend to automate the setup of a snapshot service for WAX mainnet and testnet.
https://github.com/ankh2054/snapshots.sentnl.io
https://github.com/ankh2054/snapshot-service

* Update JSON on chain to refelect bp.json

We created a script that automatically downloads your guilds JSON from your website and pushes it to chain using greymass producerjson contract using cron.

https://github.com/ankh2054/updateJSONtochain

## EOS monitor - We created a EOS node monitoring tool that monitors your nodeos and alerts if if there any issues.

https://github.com/ankh2054/eosmonitor



### Hyperion missing blocks feature - A script that automates finding missing blocks in hyperion.

https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api/scripts/fix_missing_blocks 

Updated the script to work with all version of hyperion.

https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-history-api/pull/140


### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:
