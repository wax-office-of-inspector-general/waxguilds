### chat.sentnl.io

An implementation of a AI hosted chatbot designed to facilitate questions and answers around the EOS documentation. 

**Next steps:**

- Integrate all Stack Exchange data and offer answers as a supplementary resource alongside the existing EOS documentation site.
- Develop a widget that enables WAX or EOSIO documentation websites to seamlessly incorporate the chat functionality.
- Provide an easily installable Docker container, allowing the WAX team to deploy the service and integrate it into their documentatin site.
- Potential to create a discord or telegram bot also.



### Github CI smart contract vulnerability scanners for EOSIO and ETH

We wanted to just touch base on all the tools we have developed for the Guild community:

* Delphi oracle Docker - We created a docker image to easily allow new Guilds get setup with pushing pricing feeds to the oracle.  https://github.com/ankh2054/delphioracle

* Snapshot service Docker and automated website - We created a docker image and ReactJS frontend to automate the setup of a snapshot service for WAX mainnet and testnet.

We created a script that automatically downloads your guilds JSON from your website and pushes it to chain using greymass producerjson contract using cron.
