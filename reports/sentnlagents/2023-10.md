### 4. Missing Blocks API

An app that captures missing blocks for Mainnet and Testnet and exposes the information via an API. 
The process also captures any empty blocks on mainnet, with data also accessible via the API.

As mentioned in my telegram post, we developed the code and OIAC created the infrastructure to run the code continuously  without interruption.

## Community tools 

We wanted to just touch base on all the tools we have developed for the Guild community:

* Delphi oracle Docker - We created a docker image to easily allow new Guilds get setup with pushing pricing feeds to the oracle.  https://github.com/ankh2054/delphioracle

* Snapshot service Docker and automated website - We created a docker image and ReactJS frontend to automate the setup of a snapshot service for WAX mainnet and testnet.
https://github.com/ankh2054/snapshots.sentnl.io
https://github.com/ankh2054/snapshot-service

* Update JSON on chain to refelect bp.json

We created a script that automatically downloads your guilds JSON from your website and pushes it to chain using greymass producerjson contract using cron.

### Github CI smart contract vulnerability scanners for EOSIO and ETH

https://github.com/Sentnl/EOSIO-Vulnerability-Scanner

https://github.com/Sentnl/Solidity-Vulnerability-Scanner

Both of these tools establish a connection with the OpenAI API, examining all C++ or Solidity files within your GitHub repository for potential vulnerabilities related to EOSIO and ETH Smart contracts. The present workflow is designed to execute subsequent to each push request.
