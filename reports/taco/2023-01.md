### Product Updates

- We have released a decentralized swap, with charts, graphs, direct link to the swap pair. The Swap currently counts more than 600 pairs.

- Users can pay fees in TACO and lower swap fees. Just by holding TACO in their internal Account Balance, users pay 0.25%, compared to the standard 0.3%. This fee can be further lowered to 0.15% based on the user’s amount of TACO staked into SALSA pools.
- Projects and users can book advertising banners which are displayed on Taco Swap and Taco Utility App at the same time. This provides a multi-channel promotion, boosting the reach, impressions and click through rate.
- We distribute 2% of the collected swap fees to WAX ecosystem account: netfeeac.wax. This is done at each swap with an automated system.

### Ecosystem

Taco pays the utmost attention in bringing value to the WAX blockchain, onboarding other businesses, providing smart contract developments and useful tools for other projects, encouraging the creation of new communities around Taco and serving as a launchpad for other games.

### Ecosystem #1: Hausmann & Co. 1794

[Hausmann & Co. is the first high-end watchmaking retailer in Italy to join Web 3.0](https://hausmann-co.com/en/stories/diary/hausmann-co-in-the-metaverse/)., with a platform on WAX entirely built by Taco. The project is called: from 1794, to the future. Every day Hausmann mints 20+ NFTs to their high-spending customers to authenticate buy/sell/repair of their luxury watches in their physical boutiques. The collection is verified on AtomicHub, and this represents a valuable use case for WAX. The project will run for the entire 2023.

Currently 25 SALSA and 120 MEAL incentivizes pools are active, distributing 200+ daily rewards. Since Taco Swap launch, 40 SALSA and 300 MEAL have been created.

MEAL: [https://swap.tacocrypto.io/meal](https://swap.tacocrypto.io/meal)

SALSA: [https://swap.tacocrypto.io/salsa](https://swap.tacocrypto.io/salsa)

### Ecosystem #4: Venues - Communities

Venues are the main aggregation centers and interfaces to the Taco Universe. They are customizable NFTs around which new communities are constantly built. Currently more than 10 communities have been built around Venues, serving as onboarding platforms for both Taco and WAX.

Venues are deeply linked to Brigade. Players can enter Brigade and select a Venue where they can execute a work and earn SHING. By doing this, they can also win NFTs, which are distributed by the single Venues. Currently, Venues are distributing more than 200 NFTs every day.

Following some of these communities:
- Shingland
- Nostalg33k
- QHop
- The Colony NFT
- Cozy's
- Burnouts Elysium Digital
- Brix Society
- The Council of Venues

### Ecosystem #5: Launchpad for third-party games

Third-party games are autonomous projects which gravitate around Taco. They’re built around Taco tokenomics, and because of this Taco serves as a launchpad.

The main use case is Taco Racers, a game built around TACO and SHING tokens. In March 2022, Taco helped Taco Racers during its launch, leading to a sold out drop and ensuring that the Taco Racers team had enough funding to develop their game. 

Taco Racers then launched Tuning Mode, their racing game, which counts 15k daily races. They have also minted more than 30k NFTs.

Taco doesn’t receive any compensation for that, but asks that 10% of each future Taco Racers drop is held in TACO token to allow the Taco community to easily access the game.
