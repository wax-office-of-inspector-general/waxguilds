---

We got involved with WAX in June 2021, when we created the [Taco collection on AtomicHub.](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/wax-mainnet/taco) At first, we thought WAX needed a mobile app which helped users to have a better overall experience with the blockchain, and released the app in Beta. [Full app release](https://wax-io.medium.com/claim-blockchain-game-rewards-anytime-anywhere-with-next-gen-app-taco-92b612f6024d) in April 2022. Between the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, we developed the Taco Universe Metaverse Platform, with the release of Extractors, Venues and Taco Universe, to further engage our community. In March 2022 we released our clicker game, [Brigade](https://wax.bloks.io/account/brigade.taco), to onboard new users on WAX. In August 2022 we released [Taco Swap](https://wax.bloks.io/account/swap.taco), to introduce easy DeFi for WAX users. In November 2022 we released [Acryptia](https://wax.bloks.io/account/acr.taco), to improve the gaming experience on WAX and onboard real gamers.

## Has anyone in the Guild previously produced blocks on an EOSIO or DPOS network in the past? If so, which ones and what nodes did they help operate?

---

No members of the Guild previously produced blocks on an EOSIO or DPOS network.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

---

We are currently providing RPC API and have the infrastructure ready on testnet and mainnet.
Being our first application, we produced on testnet for almost a month with a median EOS Mechanics execution time of 0.208.
We are working to provide more public API during the next weeks.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

---

Being the first submission we are providing full updates for each Taco product.

## Deals & developments that positively impact the development of the WAX ecosystem. 

Taco pays the utmost attention in bringing value to the WAX blockchain, onboarding other businesses, providing smart contract developments and useful tools for other projects, encouraging the creation of new communities around Taco and serving as a launchpad for other games.

### Ecosystem #1: Hausmann & Co. 1794

[Hausmann & Co. is the first high-end watchmaking retailer in Italy to join Web 3.0](https://hausmann-co.com/en/stories/diary/hausmann-co-in-the-metaverse/)., with a platform on WAX entirely built by Taco. The project is called: from 1794, to the future. Every day Hausmann mints 20+ NFTs to their high-spending customers to authenticate buy/sell/repair of their luxury watches in their physical boutiques. The collection is verified on AtomicHub, and this represents a valuable use case for WAX. The project will run for the entire 2023.

### Ecosystem #2: Farming Tales

Taco has been developing Farming Tales smart contracts since their launch. We also created and are currently maintaining a Unity-WAX wrapper for their 3D game. Farming Tales is one of the most popular games on WAX, with over 100M WAX in secondary market sales, 600k assets and more than 10k users.

### Ecosystem #3: MEAL and SALSA pools

Taco Swap has an incentivized pools system. Each pool can be created and managed independently by projects, through the Taco Swap dashboard. Currently 25 SALSA and 120 MEAL incentivizes pools are active, distributing 200+ daily rewards. Since Taco Swap launch, 40 SALSA and 300 MEAL have been created. Each incentivized pool give a new use case to the tokens involved. Rewards are distributed every day at 9:00 UTC with an automated system.

MEAL: [https://swap.tacocrypto.io/meal](https://swap.tacocrypto.io/meal)

SALSA: [https://swap.tacocrypto.io/salsa](https://swap.tacocrypto.io/salsa)

### Ecosystem #4: Venues - Communities

Venues are the main aggregation centers and interfaces to the Taco Universe. They are customizable NFTs around which new communities are constantly built. Currently more than 10 communities have been built around Venues, serving as onboarding platforms for both Taco and WAX.

Venues are deeply linked to Brigade. Players can enter Brigade and select a Venue where they can execute a work and earn SHING. By doing this, they can also win NFTs, which are distributed by the single Venues. Currently, Venues are distributing more than 200 NFTs every day.

Following some of these communities:
- Shingland
- Nostalg33k
- QHop
- The Colony NFT
- Cozy's
- Burnouts Elysium Digital
- Brix Society
- The Council of Venues

### Ecosystem #5: Launchpad for third-party games

Third-party games are autonomous projects which gravitate around Taco. Theyâ€™re built around Taco tokenomics, and because of this Taco serves as a launchpad.

The main use case is Taco Racers, a game built around TACO and SHING tokens. In March 2022, Taco helped Taco Racers during its launch, leading to a sold out drop and ensuring that the Taco Racers team had enough funding to develop their game. 

Taco Racers then launched Tuning Mode, their racing game, which counts 15k daily races. They have also minted more than 30k NFTs.

Taco doesnâ€™t receive any compensation for that, but asks that 10% of each future Taco Racers drop is held in TACO token to allow the Taco community to easily access the game.
