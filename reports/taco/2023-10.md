Taco pays the utmost attention in bringing value to the WAX blockchain, onboarding other businesses, providing smart contract developments and useful tools for other projects, encouraging the creation of new communities around Taco and serving as a launchpad for other games.

### Ecosystem #1: NFT World Cup Bridge

We helped to bridge the NFT World Cup to WAX. NFTWC is a popular Web3 gaming tournament connected with NFT Lugano event, which previously was accessible only to Polygon users and projects. Since the bridge, 5+ WAX companies joined the tournament and WAX [shared the bridge](https://twitter.com/WAX_io/status/1686413524875071496?s=20) on their socials [multiple times](https://medium.com/wax-io/wax-blockchain-unleashed-nft-world-cups-multi-dimensional-contest-b3b03d057409).
We provided detailed documentation, helped with the code and development part and gave access to our infrastructure to let their system gather the info from the chain they need through API (atomicassets and RPC).
