Our snapshot service is currently offline as we seek a new hosting environment for it. All other services remain operational and we hope to have our snapshot services back online soon.

Progress on multiple fronts has been made since our last report. The full details can be found in our progress update announcement post, which includes the release of account creation on all platforms, design work for our new web wallet called Unicove, new SDKs, and an update on development of our custom history solution.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

Aaron from our team has recently joined the EOS Network Foundation as a board member. Greymass has also joined two working groups sponsored by the ENF in order to help establish new standards, technologies, and services that not only will improve conditions for EOS but all EOSIO chains. We hope to start bridging the gap between various EOSIO chains through these initiatives and create a collaborative environment where all can see the benefits of this work.

Also included in our progress report above, we have been working with developers as more begin adopting our EOSIO Core javascript library over that of eosjs (and waxjs). Based on developer demand we included support for webauthn and the WA key type, better API response handling, and improvements to our SDKs. 

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We continue to support all WAX users who have chosen to trust Anchor as their wallet provider, as well as all applications/developers who are integrating both UAL and Anchor directly into their apps. The majority of our community engagement comes in the form of support for these two audiences, since both often require technical support from the developers responsible for the products they use.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

None at this time.
