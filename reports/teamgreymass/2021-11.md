## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

We have provided one of our regular updates to the forums, which dives into both progress on Anchor, account creation, and Robo. We also included a bunch of metrics at the end to show Anchor adoption, account creation, and API usage metrics.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

It's our belief that the work being done in the Working Groups (outlined in our update) should be considered ecosystem development. The research being performed by the groups involved fits the criteria outlined in the guidelines, in that what is being done will be applicable to WAX to help integrate new wallets, exchanges, and dApps.

There are a number of WAX block producers involved in this effort right now and everyone involved has a focus on the broader EOSIO ecosystem. I (Aaron) am acting as the coordinator for these groups and have a pretty good overview on where everything is heading - let me know if the OIG has questions or wants to chat on this topic for more information.

I'll also add that maybe now isn't the time to consider these as "complete" for this criteria, but in January when the papers are released I certainly think they qualify as one of the most important research projects done for the ecosystem.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

We are deploying a help desk platform to help us manage the increasing load of user support for Anchor to better serve our users. It's currently deployed to our new support email (support@greymass.com) and we'll be launching a support portal soon for users to enage with us on issues they're having. The bulk of support these days is WAX related, whether it be how to login to dapps or managing their account. 

Continued efforts in helping apps integrate Anchor, our SDKs, and other open source projects continues on a regular basis. 

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

None at this time.
