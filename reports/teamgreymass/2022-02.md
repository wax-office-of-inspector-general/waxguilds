Our team, along with members of EOS Nation and EOS Rio have completed the API+ paper which is now published and available here: 

https://medium.com/eos-network-foundation/api-blue-paper-e78c0be0d878

These documents contain research and initiatives which will be beneficial to WAX. The API lifecycle project contained within is beginning now with a contract given to OCI (the development agency B1 outsourced to). 

The Wallet+ paper will be published soon and was a collaboration between Greymass and Ultra. It will contain similar improvements. We are most excited about the new SDKs being proposed in this document as well as the Application Registry. 

We will be blogging on all of this over the coming weeks to express the direction we feel EOSIO needs to head to achieve greater adoption of developers and users. 

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

Continued efforts in helping apps integrate Anchor, our SDKs, and other open source projects continues on a regular basis. 

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

None at this time.
