Greymass

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

1. DelphiOracle scripts have been updated to once again include WAXP-ETH and meeting the requirement for "Publishing feed data via an oracle service". The reports showed us not meeting the 3 pair criteria recently, and just wanted to make sure we addressed this (if you haven't updated it already).

2. We are receiving a 0-point score for history since it's classified as "v1", yet are providing full history which is utilized by a large number of applications (including AtomicHub, WAXBlocks, Bloks, etc). We had a call a few months ago to discuss our hosted solution (Roborovski) and was under the assumption that despite the solution not yet being open source, our hosting of the solution would meet the criteria of "Providing History Solutions".
