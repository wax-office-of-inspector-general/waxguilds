## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

All of our infrastructure was patched regarding the recent vulnerability that was discovered. 

We also updated our BP.json to contain "Roborovski" as a feature on our APIs.

For reporting API access metrics, we don't have a long retention window, but I can provide some short term statistics easily. We will have to work on a more permanent solution to retain more long term data for various endpoints.

This data is for July 14th 2023, grouped by what I understood the API endpoints of interest were:

```
18,042,108 requests to v1/chain/get_table_rows (general nodeos API endpoint)
 1,622,253 requests to v1/history/get_transaction (Roborovski API endpoint)
   393,369 requests to v1/history/get_actions (Roborovski API endpoint)
```

It's worth noting these are only POST requests for Roborovski endpoints, since GET requests all have unique URLs which our data aggregation doesn't account for. Each GET request has a unique URL path due to the parameters included in the URL, so we'll need more advanced aggregation tools to include those.
