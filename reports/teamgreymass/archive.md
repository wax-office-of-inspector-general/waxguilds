    Just last week we finished releasing major version updates to a large number of our SDKs and libraries. The major features this brings to WAX is:
    Account Creation via Anchor Resource Management via Fuel
    Fuel Integration via anchor-link and/or UALOptional transaction fees as an alternative to resource management via Fuel.
    Individual project updates including the above information can be found on our living roadmaps:

    Yesterday we launched an event to give away free WAX accounts through the iOS version of Anchor. Unsure if this qualifies as community engagement as defined by the OIG, but in the past ~24 hours we have seen ~100 accounts claimed so far.[https://twitter.com/greymass/status/1362571016157990912](https://twitter.com/greymass/status/1362571016157990912)

## September 2020

- **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations criteria? Please provide details.** 
Last month we lost the 2 points for "full history access". This month we finished deploying our full custom history solution onto our public WAX API endpoints, which resolved the issues presented by the EOS Nation validator tool and our APIs are no longer missing any transaction history.
- **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development criteria? Please provide details.** 
Individual project roadmaps are updated for the past 30 days and are available here:  
Anchor: [https://forums.greymass.com/t/greymass-roadmap-anchor-wallet/85/9](https://forums.greymass.com/t/greymass-roadmap-anchor-wallet/85/9)

After comments made in telegram regarding API-based projects, we have also divided our API roadmap into 2 sections, one that shows our development efforts towards building API solutions and another that shows updates to our infrastructure. This will hopefully make it easier to evaluate where development efforts in the realm of APIs are going and not muddy the perspective with normal operational efforts. We do want to keep those efforts visible in the roadmap for informational purposes, but understand that "running an API" isn't a project.

Nothing notable at this time. We continue to work with businesses and community members to integrate our open source projects into their applications in an effort to help connect their apps with Anchor users.

## August 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

We operate history, despite losing those points last month. Upon reviewing whether or not we needed to submit updates here is when we noticed those points went missing. It appears the EOS Nation validator is only passing 6 of the 7 tests, which we will get resolved.

## March 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

The P2P address in our bp.json has been corrected and is accessible.A note on our bp.json/chain.json - we moved hosts today and the EOS Nation validator is having troubles retrieving them (CORS). They exist at the appropriate locations and we will have this resolved shortly.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

Since this is a new section, this part of the report is going to be longer than usual. If this ends up being unreadable in the form viewer, I've also created a gist with this information which can be found here:

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Business Development?**

The only point within biz-dev we could consider applying for at this point would be "bridging service providers...", since we are starting to actively work with a number of dapps to integrate the ESR signing protocol. None of these are WAX exclusive at this point, but we hope to start engaging in this type of business development as the protocol becomes more adopted.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

None yet.

Somehow improving how product information could be submitted would be a good step forward, once that section becomes more solidified. Thanks again for the work put forth in managing this chaos.

## January 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

Few things: we have joined the testnet, developed an automated BP failover script, as well as increased our redundancy of producer nodes to prevent another outage like we had in late 2019.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

We have continued to refine Anchor, releasing multiple 1.0 RC builds since our last update.

We have also updated our new signing protocol to revision 2, which now includes identity and session management, and integrated this into Anchor. The eosio-signign-request library has been updated accordingly, and a new library called anchor-link has an alpha release to facilitate the usage of these new features.

On the API front, we have started deploying our new custom history solution that matches the v1 history specification and provides a massive savings on server resources.

On the developer front, we have released a new Swift library for iOS developers which allows EOSIO integration in a pure Swift application.

The final update since our last review with the OIG is that Fuel, our cosigning service, is ready to support multiple chains and we can bring it to WAX as the need arises. We have created a number of documents, examples, and blog posts on how to use this service from the dapp perspective.

# Pre-Evaluation Form Responses

### Please provide some information regarding when and how your Guild got involved with the EOSIO or WAX ecosystem. Links to resources are helpful.

We got involved in DPoS chains back when Steem launched, participated there for a few years, and then also adopted EOS at launch and new EOSIO chains as they came online.Far too much to dive into here, but our blog (https://blog.greymass.com) covers a lot of that history.

### Has anyone in the Guild previously produced blocks on an EOSIO or DPOS network in the past? If so, which ones and what nodes did they help operate?

Our history of block production includes: Steem, Decent, Muse, Karma, Peerplays, Golos, EOS, WAX, Lynx, Insights, Lisk, Ark, Nano, and various testnets.

### If your Guild has a warrant canary, please provide the link to it.

### If your Guild has a live video inspection of your infrastructure, please provide the link to it.

### Please provide information regarding projects that your Guild is working on to improve the WAX ecosystem. Information about plans, progress, and timelines is helpful. This includes projects that have been submitted for the WAX Guild Showcase program.

Our current efforts revolve around EOSIO projects including Anchor (desktop wallet), a new API layer, a signing protocol (dapp integration), SDKs/Libraries for devs, and smart contract development.Our WAX introduction post shows some of this, as well as these resources: 

https://blog.greymass.com/eos/@greymass/greymass-team-update-first-half-of-2019

https://blog.greymass.com/eos/@greymass/contributions-overview-of-greymass-for-eosio-thus-far

### Please state the jurisdiction your Guild is domiciled in, as well as the jurisdiction that your Guild's nodes are deployed in.

Canada, with additional nodes in the United States, Germany, and France.

### Please share any usage metrics you have, if any. This includes data specific to applications and user activity driven to the WAX ecosystem as a result of your Guild's efforts.

We do not record usage metrics of our products, either because it is not possible (being a dapp) or out of respect to user privacy.The only metric we really have is that our desktop wallet has seen over 140k downloads and our APIs service around 200-400m requests a day for various EOSIO chains.

### If possible, please share information about businesses that your Guild is engaging with that are seeking to learn about and leverage the WAX ecosystem in some way.

None we can share yet.

### Please share any information regarding community building efforts championed by your Guild. This can be facilitating translation of documentation, organizing meetups, and otherwise driving social and human engagement within the platform.

We started a podcast (https://podcast.greymass.com/) as well as have a newsletter with ~700 subscribers (https://greymass.substack.com/).Both are focused on the EOSIO ecosystem.

### Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

Shared already in telegram, nothing additional yet.

Notes:

1. Argument can be made for not running Hyperion.
2. Which criteria are specifically for WAX? Should be explicit.
3. Planning to work on new API design.
4. Helping users configure anchor for WAX in Greymass channel.
5. Clarify if criteria is for 3rd parties relationships.
