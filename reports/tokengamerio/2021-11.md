Token Gamer

# Technical Operations
Security, performance, and reliability are paramount at Token Gamer. Our infrastructure is designed to meet these three key requirements, whilst also being able to keep up with the ever-increasing demands of the WAX network.

We have chosen to use all bare metal infrastructure for our initial infrastructure footprint, but we haven’t ruled out more cloud-native models for the future. For now, bare metal gives us complete control of our physical resources. We are able to tune these servers in order to perform optimally and efficiently for their specific allocated roles.

Here’s a selection of our initial equipment:

## 3 x Block Producers (Prod, Backup, TestNet)
+ Intel i9-9900k
+ 128GB Memory
+ NVME

## APIs (Prod/TestNet)
+ Intel i9-9900k
+ 128GB Memory
+ NVME

## Peers (Prod/TestNet)
+ Intel i9-9900k
+ 128GB Memory
+ NVME

## Atomic, IPFS, and Custom TG APIs
+ Intel i9-9900k
+ 128GB Memory
+ NVME + HDD

## State History
+ Intel i9-9900k
+ 128GB Memory
+ NVME + HDD

## Hyperion
+ Intel 9-9900k
+ 128GB Memory
+ NVME

As time progresses and the WAX ecosystem continues to gain traction, we plan to scale some of these functions out to provide a more geographically diverse and resilient platform that can continue to meet the ever-changing requirements.

## Security
Our platform and its users’ security is always at the forefront of our thoughts. We operate a ‘secured by design’ mantra. All infrastructure changes are peer-reviewed and deployed via automation, and all administrative access is restricted via secured bastions to only those in the team who absolutely need it.

We use hardened operating system configuration by default and consider the security implications of every change we make, regardless of size.

Automation, Change Control, and Monitoring
At Token Gamer, we manage our infrastructure via IAC (Infrastructure as Code) methods wherever possible. All changes are tested, reviewed, and deployed in a repeatable manner. When dealing with servers at scale and providing mission-critical services, there is no other option.

Unfortunately, hardware fails… all the time; It’s just one of those things. The only way to be ready for this, is to prepare for failure and monitor everything. At Token Gamer, we use DataDog for exactly that purpose. Their platform provides us with key metrics at our fingertips, so we can keep on top of our infrastructure anywhere, anytime. DataDog has plenty of customization, integrations with common software stacks, and numerous alerting options, so we can be confident that we can resolve any issues as quickly as possible.

## DCs and Expandability
We’ve chosen to host our equipment with Hertzner. There are many reasons for this. Whilst cost is obviously a factor, their great support, quick deployments, and focus on environmental sustainability are of the utmost importance to us. Alongside this, they have heavily customizable hardware (and virtual) platforms we can take advantage of.

Whilst Hertzner is our choice for today, we will continue to evaluate options as we scale and move towards the future.

## Website
Founded in 2018, ramped up heavily in 2021, now posting daily content. Monthly views still in the low thousands but month-on-month growth ranging from 150% to 450%. Two our most successful articles are solely about WAX:

[Wax is the most active blockchain in the world...](https://tokengamer.io/wax-is-the-most-active-blockchain-in-the-world-are-they-a-future-gaming-titan/?external=1)

[The genius pivot of topps to nfts the key to waxs future...](https://tokengamer.io/the-genius-pivot-of-topps-to-nfts-the-key-to-waxs-future-and-their-role-in-blockchain-gaming/?external=1&external=1)

## Mobile App (In Development)
The Token Gamer app is still in development and scheduled for release within the next month, as a result we would like it considered for evaluation. The app has three fundamental features: a live news feed of our articles (as well as external articles we deem of interest) on blockchain gaming, an integrated WAX NFT viewer so you can easily view your assets, and our gaming drops calendar so players never miss out. 

As evidence, you can view a gif [demonstration](https://tokengamer.io/media/tg_app.gif) of the closed beta build.

## WAXaccount
[WAXaccount](waxaccount.com) is a site that delivers key WAX account metrics in a single view. 

Released: Total USD value of your wallet, including Atomic NFTs based on estimated value, staked CPU, NET, and RAM, WAX tokens like R-PLANET’s Aether, and staking rewards. We are also providing a free public [API](waxaccount.com/api/account-detail) (POST { "account": "1234.waa" }) for the wider community.

In Development: More comprehensive analytics including recent transactions, ROI, etc.


# Community Engagement and Marketing

## Podcast: WAX Lyrical
The WAX Lyrical podcast is a collaboration with the founder of Pink.gg’s NFT Insider, John Nichols. WAX Lyrical is focused on all things WAX and every week, Rob and John discuss a topic in-depth. The first episode of this weekly podcast is on blockchain gaming and we have received a great response. [It was even Tweeted by William Quigley](https://tokengamer.io/media/William_E_Quigley_WAX_Lyrical_podcast_tweet.JPG)

You can listen to WAX Lyrical on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/3KPWBHAtcYe03xMNHcKuDo?external=1), [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/1-blockchain-gaming/id1597583201?i=1000543226196&external=1), or [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/waxlyrical?external=1).

## WAX Gaming Drops Calendar
The [Token Gamer drops calendar](https://tokengamer.io/drops) is specific to drops that are relevant to the gaming space. Its purpose is twofold; Firstly, it allows players to never miss a gaming release or drop. Secondly, it provides a valuable data source for our mobile app, giving WAX users complete visibility of upcoming WAX gaming activity.

## Freelance Educational Journalism for WAX
In addition to content creation for Token Gamer in its various forms, Rob is also a freelance writer in the blockchain space. As well as writing educational content for a number of outlets, Rob has also been writing and publishing articles commissioned by WAX themselves. For example, a piece on NonFungible.com — one of the largest NFT blogs — explains the WAX EVM. Below are links to that article and other educational pieces already published at the time of writing this.

## Social Media Engagement
Since 2018 we have been active on the WAX Telegram (when it was public), and WAX Discord. We have provided assistance to new users and attempted to better the community through social engagement, attached are a small sample of evidencial screenshots.

We regularly engage with the WAX official Twitter, as well as William Quigley, Atomic Hub, NFT Insider, and other WAX-centric Twitter accounts. For our modest but growing following, our engagement for Tweets about WAX tend to do well. For example, when we only had 200-300 followers, [we still got just shy of 40,000 views](https://tokengamer.io/media/tg_tweet_1.png).

# Do You Have Any Feedback for Improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or This Form?
Our feedback for the IGs is that they have all been superb; on-hand to clarify and offer assistance in a complex process — truly assets to WAX. As for the documentation, we feel it was a little lacking in places, primarily due to how deep the application process is. Some parts were outdated and some areas could have used more information, though nothing major. Rob is happy to assist in improving the document if that's of interest.
