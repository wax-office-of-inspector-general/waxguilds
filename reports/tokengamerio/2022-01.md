## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

It's been a very busy month for our Tech. We recognised short-falls in our first month - missing full v2 history, oracle not configured, low resiliency, poor monitoring - and worked to rectify. Over the next few months we aim to complete WAXaccount.com, enhance our app and continue to add resiliency to our infrastructure. Special thanks to Ben & Nils at NFTHive and Ross at EOS Sphere, these guys have been extremely helpful and are a credit to the community.
