The last month has been our busiest yet, and we've experienced explosive growth. We've gained roughly 3000 app users and 750 discord users after starting our WAX marketing campaign, aiming at promoting WAX gaming projects and our mobile app. We secured NFT donations from nearly all of the top gaming projects on WAX, which are being given away for free, daily, over the course of a month (still ongoing). WAXaccount is now in alpha, with WCW login working - this is a huge milestone and we will continue to adjust based on feedback. We also released [paid](https://neftyblocks.com/c/tokengamerio) membership and VIP NFTs (giving away 200/1000 membership NFTs for free) to establish a loyal user base. 
**Purchasing our NFTs is not a requirement to participate equally in the current WAX gaming NFT giveaway/competition.**
