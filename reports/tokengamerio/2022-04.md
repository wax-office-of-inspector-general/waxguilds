Another busy period for Token Gamer! For the past 6 weeks we have been focusing on company structure, improving existing products and maintaining growth. After several months of preparation, we are excited to announce that we have incorporated in the Isle of Man, 'TGG Limited' (019905V). Why is this so exciting?
* The Isle of Man is one of a handful of juristictions that provide extensive crypto regulation.
* We will soon be in a position to offer regulated services on WAX. This gives Token Gamer users a unique assurance that our services are authetic, externally reviewed and compliant with robust regulatatory requirements.

We hope to pave the way for others to follow, reducing the current industry tolerance of 'rug-pulls' and scams that are rampant on all blockchains.
 

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

Over the past 6 weeks our Infra team been focusing on ensuring a stable and reliable platform. We have worked through patching cycles for our entire estate as well as some small updates to our public APIs.

We have been continuing to improve our monitoring and this already proven to be effective. Our hosting provider lost power to a rack mid march and we were able to respond quickly with no loss of service thanks to the resiliency baked into the platform and the quick response of the alerting system.
* AtomicAssets upgraded to 1.3.11.
* We continue to have no missed rounds as an active block producer.


**Upcoming**
* We recognise from the useful Alohaeos benchmarks that other guilds are starting to reduce their block production latency with additional tuning and newer hardware, as such we are looking at options to reduce ours, during the next 6 week cycle.
* Working on providing a production ready chronicle receiver for notifications for the Token Gamer App, which is coming soon.

## Mobile App
Big update, 1.4 released! NFT searching, filtering & sharing added. Also fixed a number of crash and performance issues, full notes below. We feel that the app is now best in class, however we're not happy with the download / active user counts, especially on Android. As a result we are investing in advertising and marketing for the app - we have banner ads on NFTHive & a banner ad submitted to WAX for display on the front page of WCW. We have also commissioned a video teaser for the app. \

* Android stats - We made an incorrect assumption in our previous report that android stats were delayed. After investigation it looks like we have a much higher uninstall rate in android than expected. Our marketing drive will fix this: \

**Upcoming**
* Notifications! WAX account activity, article updates & new drops. Very exciting.
* Video teaser for the app.

## Podcast
WAX Lyrical podcast rebranded to Mint One podcast as there were so many “Wax Lyrical” podcasts (and Google cares not for capitalization,) that SEO dictated we wouldn’t get the organic traffic we were after. Nothing changed other than the name; we’re still WAX-centric. Our audience is continuing to grow and we have more guests lined up. 
* Mint One is now on episode 20. \

## WAXAccount
WAXAccount has undergone a massive design overhaul. We have added a landing page, utilising stats from WAX Market Cap's public API (Thanks Ben!). We expect WAXAccount v1 to launch in May. \
