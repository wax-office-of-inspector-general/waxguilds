It has been an incredibly busy period for us. We are finalising our company structure and applying for licenses to ensure we can offer fully regulated and transparent services. We have been ramping up our content and products, as well as hiring a streamer, launching our Twitch and YouTube channels, designing our upcoming tokenomics and rolling out major updates to our apps.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

* Usual patching cycles completed
* 99.995% block producing availability since last report
* Upgraded AA to 1.3.13
* Various fixes around our platform to meet validation service requirements after helpful collaboration with @blacklusion - Mostly enabling distinct HTTP endpoints as we previously had HTTP redirect to HTTPS across the board.
* Additional backend infrastructure and automation provisioned to support notifications in Token Gamer App

**Upcoming**
* Migrating public infra from tokengamer.io to tgg.gg to separate our tech and content products. 


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?
## Mobile App
Major version app released featuring WAX transaction notifications - big thanks to **cc32d9** for creating the Chronicle service and providing advice. We believe that this new feature is a significant improvement over existing telegram bots - activity notifications alongside WAX gaming media, NFTs and account metrics.

We secured a front page ad on the WCW for the TG app! \

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
We have maintained our daily, high-quality content. We are continuously hiring established and talented journalists and writers. We are working closely with many projects on WAX, including Blockchain Brawlers, to not only bring the best quality content in the space, but to attract new eyes on WAX.

* Rob is part of a core group of ambassadors for Blockchain Brawlers, relaying feedback and interfacing with the team.
* DYGYCON 9 booth in Atomic Hub’s hall where we spent the event engaging with the crypto community and many WAX fans.
* [A giveaway and article for The Forge Arena](https://tokengamer.io/were-giving-away-10-nft-skins-for-competitive-fps-the-forge-arena/)
* [A giveaway and article for R-Planet and its WAX-based ambassadors](https://tokengamer.io/500-worth-of-nfts-to-giveaway-token-gamer-x-r-planet/)
* A major Blockchain Brawlers article created off the back of calls and multiple coversations with Michael Rubinelli, David Pava, and David Kim, including exclusive information: [3 Reasons Why Blockchain Brawlers Is Going to Be Huge: Exclusive Info!](https://tokengamer.io/3-reasons-why-blockchain-brawlers-is-going-to-be-huge-exclusive-info/)
* [A giveaway and article for Blockchain Brawlers Artifact packs.](https://tokengamer.io/giveaway-5-artifact-packs-for-play-to-earn-giant-blockchain-brawlers/)
* We were a major sponsor of AnyObservations's The Forge Arena tournament, pledging 5,000 WAX to the prize pool
* We are continually pushing for interesting and promising games to choose WAX or to migrate to WAX. We recently set up a meeting between WAX and 9 Lives Arena, a 3D PvP game that has been on Enjin for the last 4 years.

**Upcoming**
* We are trialling yet more writers, with one highly promising addition likely to join us permanently.
* Rob has written a substantial piece for NFT Insider on WAX's merits and why its price and coin ranking is irrelevant, to be published in June.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
* Token Gamer Discord server has ~700 new members and we expect this to drastically increase after WAXAccount launch.
* We launched a Token Gamer Twitch channel, hiring an established streamer (Jonah Lesnick, AKA SuperDope), and had a brilliant inaugural stream. SuperDope opened a Blockchain Brawlers Artifact pack live on stream, then played The Forge Arena with the CEO, M1NAC, discussing the game as they went and answering viewers' questions. We peaked at over 100 viewers (putting us comfortably in the top 10 of the "crypto" category on Twitch), average 78.3 viewers, gained 269 unique viewers, and 78 new followers. [First stream VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1309806912)
* We have relaunched the Token Gamer YouTube channel which will house the highlights of each stream — [here's the first highlights reel](https://youtu.be/Vmnd8T5uZM8) — with plans for more content in the works.
* An additional 927 followers on Twitter in the last 6 weeks: \
