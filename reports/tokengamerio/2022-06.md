We've spent the last 6 weeks building our video content channels (Twitch & YouTube), improving our article exposure, optimising SEO, polishing WAXAccount.com and adding functionality to the Token Gamer mobile app. In addition, we have completed the draft documentation required for our token launch, which we will be submitting to local regulators next month. Our tokenomic plans will be released as soon as we have regulatory approval.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

* Usual patching cycles completed.
* 99.995% block producing availability since last report.

## WAXAccount

**Upcoming**
* WAXAccount v1 launch.

## Twitch
We launched Twitch and YouTube during the previous period but were informed that they were too new to rate. Since then both products have grown significantly. We feel strongly that both products should be rated independently as we have invested significant resources into each, and both provide a highly valuable platform for WAX exposure. As with all Token Gamer products, we aim to achieve a level of quality that is rare for the space.
* 33hrs streamed.
* +487 followers.
* 27 average, 150 peak viewer count. This is exceptional for a brand new channel.
* WAX is either featured or mentioned in every stream, without fail.
* Music Mogal featured with a giveaway and live pack opening.
* Blockchain Brawlers featured with a giveaway and live pack opening.
* 1 x 2 hour stream on WAX Studios
* 2 x 2 hour streams on Forge Arena, CEO M1nac was a guest.
