## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

* This month we have been working on infrastructure stability improvements, bumping versions of nodeos across the estate and patching as usual.
* We have added additional capacity to our Hyperion cluster to keep up with ever increasing storage demands.
* We have fully transitioned to our new infra domain tgg.gg which brings with it improved reliability and resiliency behind the scenes. 
* We have no missed rounds in the last month.
* As seen recently there has been some issues with queued and expired transactions. As a relatively new guild, we haven't been able to provide contributions to deep analysis of the ongoing issues, but we have been keeping a keen eye on the guild groups and making tweaks in order to try to improve our configuration as per recommendations. We are of course learning a lot through this experience and hope to be able to provide more insight in the future.

## WAXAccount
* We have completed phase 1 our our token launch. WAXaccount is now connected to our mobile app via a QR code system (app update live in a week or 2). This enables us to proceed with our regulatory filing which requires basic user KYC.

## Discord
We have taken the initiative to create a new WAX Community Discord server. Disconnected Telegram channels are simply inferior for collaboration, learning, and development in a complex ecosystem like WAX. The server has 89 users from guilds and project owners only, we have not started promoting to the community yet. Despite our efforts here, 50% of guilds are not interested in participating, we find this incredibly frustrating. Guild complaints are primarily personal UX issues, which are insignificant compared to the benefit to WAX that a central communication & resource hub could provide.

* We formally ask the OIG to start providing updates there, we feel this is critical to encouraging stubborn Guild members from using.
* We have configured a telegram / discord bridge bot which replicates messages between the 2 platforms. This is live in the main Dev chat.
* We have created a 'missed round' alert bot that will initially match the features of the current Telegram bot. We will enhance this to also include relevant guild notifications such as report submission dates, consistently low transactions per block, etc. This is currently in testing and will be live over the next few days.
* Ledgerwise Guild have created a bot for promoting projects that have been added to WAXZILLA, this provides a curated, consistent project highlight system that gives exposure to all projects on WAX equally. They are adding Discord commands to find any project, including dev resources. We mention this in our report in case Ledgerwise do not, to ensure they get points for this effort.

## Twitch
* Anders can corroborate the frequent WAX mentions and dedicated streams that were mentioned in our 2 previous reports but were not point worthy due to lack of evidence.
* We have started adding Twitch VoDs to YouTube, in addition to the dedicated videos.
* +46 subs.
* +634 followers.
* WAX is either featured or mentioned in every stream, without fail.
* Music Mogal featured with a giveaway and live pack opening.
* Blockchain Brawlers featured with a giveaway and live pack opening.
* 1 x 2 hour stream on WAX Studios
* 2 x 2 hour streams on Forge Arena, CEO M1nac was a guest.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
Tokengamer.io has continued with daily, high-quality content, as well as networking to get WAX's name out there further.

* Major article and giveaway for Warsaken, over 2,400 entries: ![Warsaken article & giveaway](https://tokengamer.io/huge-giveaway-over-500-worth-of-nfts-for-warsaken/)
* WAX NFT giveaways multiple times per week on and off stream.
* WAX game featured in TG's top 5 P2E games for July and August 2022.
* Rob is beta testing Blockchain Brawlers

Gamescom 2022: Rob attended over 30 meetings with industry leaders. Rob brought up WAX in every single meeting, scheduled or incidental, and it was the first time many people had heard of the chain. Following on from this, Rob is making several introductions to senior WAX figures for potential collaboration. We realise that this is hard to "prove" but pink.gg were also present and can corroborate all facts.

This level of on-the-ground networking with major Web3 and gaming organisations should not be underestimated and I'm sure you can appreciate the value. Given WAX had no presence there (whereas Polygon, Immutable, and so on all did), this kind of promotion and awareness raising with industry players, large and small, is priceless. We didn't do this for financial gain or even in the hope to get points out of it, but if that doesn't count as ecosystem development or WAX Strategic Contribution for Marketing and Promotion, we cannot imagine what does!
