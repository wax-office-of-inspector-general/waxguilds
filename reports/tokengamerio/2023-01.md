## Technical operations
This month has focused on replacing some of the existing servers with new hardware with additional capacity to support the growing ecosystem.
Patching cycles have been completed as usual.
A small outage to our Testnet producer this month with a few missed rounds after hitting the new 90% disk threshold in LEAP software.

Upcoming:
* Replacement of state history and Atomic servers for additional capacity.

## Mobile App
Alpha of Polygon integration is ready for testing. We have partnered with Polygon and they will be promoting the app when we launch the multichain version which has the potential to expose WAX to an enormous number of users.
We have seen a small spike in new users since WAX shared the app on socials again.

## Podcast
Rather than echo the incremental gains of listeners, I’d like to share some stats about the Mint One podcast from Spotify’s wrapped:
* 2,875 minutes of content created in 2022, 94% more than any other creators
* Listeners in 35 different countries
* Mint One is in the top 15% most shared podcasts globally
* Mint One is in the top 15% most followed podcasts
* Mint One has an average rating of 5/5
* Mint One is the #1 podcast for 62 fans
We talk about WAX every single episode and as our audience grows, this only becomes more powerful.

## WAXAccount
We have made some improvements and bug fixes based on user feedback in the last month.

## Twitch
Still averaging 60+ concurrent viewers and collaborating with new projects
* WAX projects have been featured weekly.
* We are continuing to work with Warsaken which has been very popular and achieved higher viewer numbers than other games!

## YouTube
We are currently working on a new content strategy for YouTube, with more highly tailored content, but have continued to see modest views and subs in the interim.

Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
* Tokengamer.io has daily, content and received ~86,000 impressions in the last 28 days, up from 78k last cycle, with regular WAX content and giveaways. The site’s consistent growth means it’s the heart of our little ecosystem and this is great for WAX as our SEO and article rankings improve.
* Rob is beta testing Blockchain Brawlers
