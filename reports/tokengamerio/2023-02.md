## Technical operations
This month we have been working on operational improvements after a couple of brief outages as seen in the tech ops reports. Notably a period of downtime with Hyperion and Atomic during cluster expansion and upgrades. 

However it is worth mentioning that some validators are recording 0% uptime for our healthy Hyperion on version 3.3.9. This is under discussion within the OIG and wider guild comminity, we appreciate all the discorse and efforts relating to this.

Additionally we have made efforts to move forward towards the LEAP release of nodeos v3.1.3wax01. We aim to have this in production across all infrastructure by 19th March 2023.

IPFS endpoint has been added to bp.json. There was no missed rounds during this cycle.

### Outage Summary
* Upgrade of Hyperion infra & software - completed on the evening 14th and blocks caught up by 16th.
* Upgrade of Atomic software - 2 days.
* Oracle down - an oversight in monitoring lead to a lengthy downtime of the oracle service, this will be fixed tomorrow morning. Monitoring improvements will be made to prevent this in future.

## Mobile App
Alpha testing for Polygon integration was successful. We're doing a closed beta test currently and plan to roll out the new version within the next 45 days. As I said, we have partnered with Polygon and they will be promoting the app when we launch the multichain version which has the potential to expose WAX to an enormous number of users.

## Podcast
The podcast has continued to grow in listenership this cycle as we have ramped up the number of interesting guests. Our YouTube channel for the podcast — the latest addition to how the podcast can be consumed — is growing faster than all other mediums with over 1k views in the past month. As always, WAX is mentioned every episode and we are currently running an ad before our episodes for the Ultraman collection on WAX in partnership with Atomic Hub. 

## WAXAccount
No development updates here, we intend to further integrate with our mobile app and offer new WAX features in the coming months.

## Twitch
Due to the downturn, multiple weekly streams won't be financially viable. Instead, we're going to do special streams in correlation with game launches, collabs with companies, Mint One podcast, and so on.

## YouTube
We are currently working on a new content strategy for YouTube, with more highly tailored content, but have continued to see modest views and subs in the interim.
