## Technical operations
During this latest cycle we again have concentrated on replacing some of our aging infrastructure. Namely SHIP servers after issues last month and reaching some capacity thresholds. The Atomic service again appears to be showing as down during periods of time this month but as far as we were aware the service was up for the majority of people (including our Apps that require it).

* Upgrades and tweaks to components and our app infrastructure since the move to LEAP releases.
* Additionally usual patching cycles completed.
* During the next cycle we wish to replace our peer servers as they are also all nearing capacity.

## Mobile App
Since the release of our Polygon integration we have continued to see progress with user engagement, downloads and concurrent users. Some stats:

## Podcast
* The podcast has had several big guests this cycle, with more scheduled. Audience size is continuing to grow, interest in being on the podcast is higher than ever, and we truly believe this is becoming valuable in exposing people to WAX. We have been running an ad for ZoS, for free, at the start of several episodes this cycle.

## WAXAccount
We are ramping up development here to gain parity with other block explorers, expect updates next report.

## YouTube
* We are currently working on a new content strategy for YouTube, with more highly tailored content, but have continued to see modest views and subs in the interim.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
* As always, we have covered WAX with articles multiple times this cycle, including ![Blockchain Brawlersâ€™ tournament](https://tokengamer.io/blockchain-brawlers-25000-waxp-esports-tournament-announced/). However, one article that was particularly popular was ![Report Shows WAX and Polygon Dominating Blockchain Gaming](https://tokengamer.io/report-shows-wax-and-polygon-dominating-blockchain-gaming/)
