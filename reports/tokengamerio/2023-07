## Technical operations
* We successfully completed infrastructure patching... again.

## Ecosystem development
At Gamescom we met with someone to discuss the WAX ecosystem. It wasn't a good fit for them at the time, but since then, the person I met with has moved onto another web3 organisation. This company (Artifact) has partnered with the likes of Activision Blizzard and Zynga, and reached back out to me to discuss it with me. From this, I set up a meeting between this person (Ricardo Rodrigues) and WAX (Michael Rubinelli) to discuss using WAX
We noticed we haven't been getting points for the podcast and think that is unfair. It is one of the few web3 podcasts out there, running weekly episodes, approaching our 2 year anniversary, and are now listed as a top 10% podcast on Listen Notes, the podcast database. We mention WAX every single episode, we push our WAX app every single episode, and have introduced countless people to the ecosystem. That must be worth something.
