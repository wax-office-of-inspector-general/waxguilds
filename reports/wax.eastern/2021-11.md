1. Onboard Token Pocket to integrate WAX Chain

We’ve been following up Token Pocket- the top 1 Chinese Crypto Wallet since last year to support WAX Chain and finally the integration process starts from Nov 22nd, the whole integration process will take 2 weeks estimately according to Token Pocket Tech team. Our techie and EOS Sweden team have also been helping TP to fix technical issues along the way.

We’ve been also helping a handful of WAX Based Dapps like Alcor.exchange, Atomichub.io, Farming Tales etc to be listed on TP wallet once the WAX integration job done.

With over 10m chinese users of Token Pocket, we believe the support of Token Pocket will boom the whole WAX Ecosystem.

**Community management initiatives** :

1. WAX Community management is always an aspect we put a lot efforts in. Due to the policy regarding to cryptocurrency industry of Chinese Government getting worse, we had to abandon the fans groups we had built on Wechat and tried to move all the community members from Chinese social media platforms to TG , Discord and Twitter. During the process we had to pour more energy and time to teach members to use VPN and use these overseas platforms. Ofc, we had lost some of the members bc of the issues like language barriers etc. At the meantime, we still try to deliver the latest updates that happening on WAX Chain and the projects on it to our Chinese audience and maintain their interests in WAX.
