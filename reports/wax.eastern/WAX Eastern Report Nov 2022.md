No we don't.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
We've been working together with Bitkeep and the quality projects on WAX to deepen the Bitkeep's integration and support of WAX ecosystem and bring their massive user base to us. We have helped them finish the integration of WAX chain itself already. 

Currently, we are working on assisting Bitkeep to  finish the integration to the projects, so the users of Bitkeep could access to the projects easily with their wallet. The next step is to help both parties carry out cross promotion events.
