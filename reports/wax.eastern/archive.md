**Community management initiatives :**

During the past month, our WAX chinese group has gained another 2K+ new members.

With more quality projects launching on WAX, it gave us more content and resources to promote WAX in chinese community. Due to the policy of chinese gov towards crypto getting tight, we also have our telegram and discord in place just in case the gov crack down crypto related wechat groups.

Except the daily management, we also host online FAQ once a week for newbies to get hands on WAX quicker.

**Community management initiatives :**

During the past month, with the TLM launch on Binance and the launch of Seeing Crypto Art Product. Our WAX chinese group have gained another 1.5k new members and keeps growing.

Due to the API and recaptcha issues of the WAX wallet, our team has been busy answering newbie’s questions and solving & reporting the issues they are facing. To better manage our WAX groups, we named the groups in WAX OG, WAX Seasoned Players, WAX Rookie, AW Mining Army etc to make members feel part of the community and arranged two OG members of WAX Eastern to help manage the groups with us.

We’ve also arranged one OG player to host online lessons of WAX 2-3 times a week to teach new members more efficiently and answer the FAQ during the week.

We are pretty looking forward to their art pieces coming to WAX and also the fans of the artists that will flood into Crypto Art and WAX.

3. This month, WAX Eastern planed to coordinate WAX team to attend the online NFT meetup held by MoonSwap along with other key players in the industry such as DEGO, Sandbox, Decentraland etc, but due to the Chinese Spring Festival vacation, the event got delayed and will be proceeded this month.

**Community management initiatives :**

During the past month, with the news of Street Fighters coming to WAX, there are more newbies joined WAX chinese community, since the SF NFT series in only available for purchasing by CC and not available for chinese users, so it took us a fair amount of time and effort to educate the new members of how to buy NFTs from secondary market on WAX, and help answer all their questions and solve their language & VPN issues.

With the support of the whole WAX community, WAX got selected for the **Most Dynamic Public Chain,** we believe this would help expand the recognition of WAX in chinese market.

**Community management initiatives :**

During the past month, with the launch of Alien Worlds, there are more members come to the WAX chinese community, since the game is only in english for now, so it took us a fair amount of time and effort to educate the new members of how to get onboard of WAX and Alien Worlds, and help answer all their questions to the game and solve their language & VPN issues. Except for the daily community management, we’ve also wrote the tutorial of Alien Worlds for newbies.

(1). In November, we reached out to two chinese wallet developers.

One is a well-known defi team who just launched their wallet--**[dfox](http://dfox.cc/)**. They're gonna support WAX next week, we’ve offered the basic technical info and APIs to them, they are expertise on EOS, integrating WAX to them is a piece of cake. They are happy to integrate WAX because they wanna offer better NFT trading experience to the users. Their wallet will support the transfer function in the next version.

Second one is a wallet app called **Touchain,** they are a digital assets management platform, now they plan to support NFT as well. We met on a NFT webinar and reached the agreement that they support WAX and the Dapps on it. They lower the threshold of entering crypto by registering accounts via phone number or email, so it would bring more newbie users to get into WAX and trading NFTs.

(2). The cooperation with Math wallet is still in the process. They are working on BSC now, and will arrange WAX as the next chain to support.
