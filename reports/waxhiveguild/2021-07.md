## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Progress on NFTHive:
- Added upliftium generation rate as a filter and display info to supported NFTs.
- Moved 100% from using Public Hyperions to Chronicle using our SHiP node, ending up making ingestion and update rates much more efficient.
- Started work to support RPlanet Element trading (Fungible Tokens)
- Moved DB and refactored tables to support increasing amount of NFTs (12M Koloboks, 10M AW Tools etc), enabled averages, last sold, revenue, cheapest listed information for all NFTs
- Added Template Search and Inspection capabilities
- Added a couple of new sets, eg Green Rabbit, Street Fighter 2, KOGS 3 etc

New Market Template:
- I'm developing a template for custom markets on WAX.
- It uses configurable Atomic APIs, which would enable market builders to use their own.
- It will have a smart contract where builders can enter their market name and collection filters, giving them the ability to build specialized markets.
- The market name can be determined in the configuration and must be the same as registered in the atomicmarket contract. Then it automatically earns fees.
- Working on prewritten queries that display the newest listings, cheapest listings and eventually some more options.
- Inventory for filtered collections
- Future plans: Support auctions, trade

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

Thank you Josep and KÃ¤fer for the great time and experience. Thank you to all the guilds that reported amazing projects and bring real value to WAX. I'm excited to join the roster and be fully on the other side next month!
