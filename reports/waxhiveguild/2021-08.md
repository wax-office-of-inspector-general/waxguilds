## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

- Atomic up and being used by our Dummy Market. Resolved an issue that blocked too many concurrent requests.
- Hyperion actually ran out of disc space. Quickly added a new Server for another elastic Search node. Didn't fall far behind, everything back up to date quickly. Status warning is due to a version mismatch between the elastic search nodes, and will be resolved shortly.
- IPFS server still running: https://ipfs.hivebp.io
- Testnet Producer + Backup ready
- Mainet Producer 1 & 2 live
- Lost some rounds testing a setting at the beginning of the month :/
- Added a backup p2p node, so this doesn't happen again

Progress on NFTHive:
- Rplanet Elements Fungible Tokens are now supported. You can buy and sell them like NFTs on the open market
- Lots of work in the backend to keep the data indexed and quickly accessible.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

Giveaways are on popular demand, because of our 10k WAX NFT interested Twitter Followers. So this month we continue to run them in order to promote launches. Of course free of charge.

Those giveaways are purely promotions for the drops of these collections. 
In comparison, a giveaway that promotes NFTHive would look like this:

Still retweeting WAX and cool stuff from around the ecosystem. 

Active in several NFT communities. Active on the Guilds and governance channels. Contributed to discussions around the resource model.

Added notifications to the Telegram bot about your sold listings:

Several Sales Feeds still active.

Helped out on WAX discord with questions, especially during the Funko launch. I'm also helping users on Facebook, who have an especially hard time understanding WAX. There are GPK, MLB and now Funko collectors groups.
Wrote an article for them on how buy WAX: https://hivebp.medium.com/how-to-buy-waxp-using-crypto-exchanges-a-step-by-step-guide-c45b604a10ce
Unfortunately while very convenient, Bittrex holds any withdrawals of Crypto for newcomers that deposited Fiat, so it's still very difficult to get WAX quickly.

Will post our public update on our Medium as well and share it on Twitter. Will send the link with the email.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

Good luck to Rakeden! Enjoy your first evaluation!
