Wax Market Cap:
We have begun development of another product called waxmarketcap.com. 
Based on all the analytics data we've gathered, we found that we want to release a stand-alone analytics product, similar to cryptoslam, but focused on WAX.
The current state is that I seperated the Analytics API from NFTHive onto its own Server, hooked it up to the second SHiP node and run it independently.
We also added Primary Sales from wdny.io to our Analytics Framework and are now recording sales from simplemarket, waxstash, myth.market, neftyblocks, atomicdrops, wdny, nft.hive, waxarena and atomicmarket. 
We differenciate between sales, auctions, drops and primary sales. It's planned that we also grab data from lgnd.art and similar primary vendors.
This is by far the most complete analytics tool that is going to exist for WAX.
