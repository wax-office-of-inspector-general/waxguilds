## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Progress on NFTHive:
- Mainly moving layout to a more responsive, faster design with Tailwind CSS
- Started on a contrac to allow reverse offers: Offering WAX to receive assets by template ID,
  deployed and testing here: https://wax.bloks.io/account/nfthiveoffer
- Brought back sorting for certain attributes on collections, eg Alien Worlds Mining Luck, Dark Country attack power etc
- Added support for Battleminers, eg filtering and sorting by special attributes, sets, etc


Market Template:
The Market Template is now released:
- Unpacking has been added, eg: https://waxdummymarket.com/packs/t1.5c.wam.
- Blending has been added, but not live on the public template. Link via Email

Wax Market Cap:
We launched the Beta of waxmarketcap.com and it comes with a public API: https://hivebp.github.io/waxmarketcap/  
So far it includes a front page with collection rankings, 24h change, 7 day performance graphs,
options from all time to 24h ranking, including drops, secondary and primary sales. Then we're also showing quick stats,
such as total number of assets (AA & SA), 24h volume, as well as Top Sales. More to come soon! This project is mostly
data collection and aggregation, which happens in the background. We've gotten very far with it.

We hired Terry Cruise to engange with the community, which is why you can see an uptick in Twitter activity.
He's a very well known and beloved community member and a great fit!

We're also active in several NFT communities, WAX, Guilds and governance channels.

We are running several sales feeds and Hive-E, our telegram Bot.
