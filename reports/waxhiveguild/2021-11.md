## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

We invested in the Cloudflare Enterprise Solutions for ca $5000 / Month, which allows for better media availability of our ipfs server, on NFTHive.io, waxmarketcap.com, better performance, caching and so on and also to protect our public APIs.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Progress on NFTHive:
- Upgraded styling on a lot of pages, market, bulk tools, sets, frontpage, inventory etc, moving further towards TailwindCss
- Created a new Filter layout for the market, bulk tools and sets, which had a very positive response.
- Improved performance by switching to preview images almost everywhere and lazy loading asset cards
- Created many new sets that are shown first on the sets overview page: https://nfthive.io/sets. Everything from Funko Halloween up is new.
- Cloudflare Enterprise Solutions improved perfomance a lot. We'll make a lot more use of that.

Market Template:
We've offered support to Anyo and Nick Kusters to use the market template and fixed some bugs while doing so. 5 other marketplaces have been created by unknown users and YoshiMarket is finally public: https://market.yoshidrops.com/
It's not yet promoted, as they still have to switch to their own API nodes.

Wax Market Cap:
We have a lot of updates on WAXMarketCap.
- A Top Assets Page has been added, showing the best performing assets across collections: https://waxmarketcap.com/assets
- Assets can be inspected, showing top sales, sales volume, details and links to cheapest listings on nfthive, atomichub and neftyblocks: https://waxmarketcap.com/asset/farmersworld/203886
- We added a graphs page, showing sales volume, top collections volume, market volumes and defi accumulation: https://waxmarketcap.com/graphs
- You can now inspect collections in detail: https://waxmarketcap.com/collection/xpansiongame
- The api has been updated: https://hivebp.github.io/waxmarketcap/


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

- As mentioned above, https://market.yoshidrops.com/ is now public. We built that page for yoshidrops based on our market template.
- We helped guilds to get started as block producers.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

Terry Cruise has been very active as a community manager. He's handling our Twitter account and retweeted hundreds of promotions, engaged with posts and ran a couple of giveaways:

There has been a lot of activity on WAX's Twitter, a lot of newcomers came through Hasbro, Hotwheels and the general activity on WAX. We've answered plenty of private DMs asking about 2FA, temporarily banned accounts, Token Swaps etc.

Updated the Hive-E Telegram Bot and allow unfavoriting directly from the bot as a response to sale reports, making it a lot more useful.

We added a Twitter Sales Bot: https://twitter.com/wax_market_cap
For this, we also created a banner service, that generates a better Twitter Image for the sale, eg: https://ipfs.hivebp.io/banner?img=QmUaG1h5fNHQY3WRvsxS8D97mQEhmkbYbutPsGzFUeRRFA
The Twitter Bot was first launched a few weeks ago and already gathered hundreds of followers, but it got nuked, probably for spam. We wrestled a bit with Twitter Support to get it reinstated, and we removed tags from the posts. Twitter enabled it again for about a day, then completely banned the account. We then recreate the bot, and made sure it's less spammy, doesn't tag accounts and doesn't use hashtags.
WAX uses it to promote sales, eg: https://twitter.com/WAX_io/status/1465702449415475203

We extended the free banner service to waxmarketcap.com and have synced it with the community banners on NFTHive.
