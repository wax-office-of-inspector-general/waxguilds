Replaced 2 old Hyperion Servers and added 3 new ones, so we're now running 4 nodes with 2 endpoints behind a load balancer.
Added a 3rd Atomic, but it's still being configured. We're getting crazy loads from being FWs main Atomic Server and getting spammed from various FW support sites.

Progress on NFTHive:
Buy Offers have been improved with more options to manage your Buy Offer Balance. Top up your balance to cover all offers, withdraw your balance above the highest offer or anything in between.

We have also made it easier to create new Buy Offers by adding a Browser over the most popular templates.
We also added a CPU renting service that has already rented out more than 200k WAX in stake in the first week here: https://nfthive.io/cpu
One of the bigger updates is the overhaul of the collection page. You can now find everything around a collection on that page and the different tabs:

The most important addition here is the Buy Top NFTs section, where you can browse every single NFT (Template) of the collection and see the five cheapest listings on the market. This is the beginning of our new approach to collections focused navigation. We hope to guide users to different collections by adding them to different categories and then give them a better overview of their NFT catalog. Other than on the open market you will find the most important NFTs first, before you’re overwhelmed with a flood of Alien World Shovels and Farmers World Coins.
Speaking of categories, our second big update are Collection Categories:

Categories are meant to separate different kinds of WAX collections from each other so they can stand out better and can be discovered by interested people. At the moment all the Play 2 Earn games are rising to the top, so it’s difficult to discover art, collectibles, and even games with more gameplay like Hodlgod, The Forge Arena etc. This is why we have created our collection overview here: https://nfthive.io/collections
To further identify collections we have created tags, which can be something like scifi, sports, music, celebrities and more. Users can suggest categories and tags and everything is recorded on the blockchain here: https://wax.bloks.io/account/clltncattool
We’re very happy with the community feedback on this one and will continue to build it out. There will be a whole new UX Design on this section.

We also maintained the RPlanet Staking mechanism to support their updates, which means we have to keep up to date with the aether rates on NFTs. Lots of support has been give there. Thousands of assets get staked and unstaked via NFTHive

We also added FW crafting costs as a guide for prices.

Also updated the Profile and User pages.

Metrics this months are: 800 Buyers, 871 Sellers, 277.8K WAX and $91.3K in Volume. Many more transactions through our Bulk Tools. It's hard to measure those.
800 Buy Offers have been created and 122 have sold. We're going to promote them more by creating a New (Good) Buy Offer Feed on the WAX Discord.

NFTHive had 81.56k Unique Visitors in the last 30 Days

The CPU Renting Service has rented out over 230k WAX to over 800 wallets in a couple of days.

Market Template:
There have been a lot of code updates on our market template as well. Our new Frontend Developer has basically modernized the entire code base. Take a look at the commit history on this one: https://github.com/hivebp/wax-market-template/commits/main

Wax Market Cap:
We haven’t update waxmarketcap.com with new features, but we have maintained it and fixed some bugs. Categories will play a role on waxmarketcap as well though, because different metrics are important to the different categories. P2E games are focus on daily volume, while all time sales might be more interesting for collectibles and marketcap (value) for art. We’re already experimenting with that on NFTHive in sorting the collections and it will become available on waxmarketcap.com

In the last 30 Days, WMC had 22.39k unique visitors

Twitter Engagement is through the roof. Not only are we continuing our giveaways, announcing collection categories has made some waves, because it's a feature on OpenSea and still missing on WAX. Creators are exited as can be seen in these tweets:

There are more, but you get the gist!

The metrics on Twitter are quite crazy:
Tweets
187 +1.6% 
Tweet impressions
122K +23.7%
Profile visits
46.7K +24.3%
Mentions
3,897 +39.7% 
Followers
17.1K +1,699

We also ran a $7000 DappRadar and $5000 Google Ad campaign. Google is great and generates a lot of clicks with targeted keywords. DappRadar is a waste of money. I wouldn't recommend anyone advertising there. Far too expensive, far too few clicks. However, Google is sometimes problematic. They'll disable your campaign for no apparent reason (It's probably NFTs). Would like to get back on there, but we're blacklisted until further appeal.
