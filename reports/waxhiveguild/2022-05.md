Metrics: 450 Buyers, 789 Sellers, 318.5K WAX, $69.8K Volume in the last 30 days
Cpu Renting makes about $10000 per month and allows many users to continue playing WAX games during high CPU times for a very low fee:
0.5% when the pools are over 25% full, else 0.75%

Market Template:
No updates. We're planning to create an open source Landing Page for collections, using drops and pack opening

Wax Market Cap:
No updates, too busy with the NFTHive Creator Tools
