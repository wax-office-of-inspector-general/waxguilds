Progress on NFTHive:
- We added a live dynamic drop calendar for our drops, which can be extended to show nefty and atomic drops as well: https://nfthive.io/dropcalendar
- We organized #DropWeek in which we got 13000 WAX and other tokens to different WAX artists and dropped hundreds of prizes to participants such as Funko packs, vBots, and #DropWeek creator NFTs. https://twitter.com/nfthiveio/status/1574298642583851012?s=20&t=xpyZZldrYI89Ub1Ll-tong 
- We are adding more pages like the template page to add full asset explorer functionalities: https://nfthive.io/template/19567
- Also added to the template page above is a live listing feed which instantly shows every new listing for that template. This is still being tested and has not been announced yet. We want to get it to work with the funko halloween drop.
- We've reworked the market UI and still busy with that. We've added hoverable info as well as a details button for indepth information and made the rest of the card design more simple. We're now working on simplifying the filters while not losing much of our deep filter system

- Playgrid.io seems to be a bit slow to add more WAX applications, although we're still working with them and WAX shows up on their games index: https://playgrid.io/app/games?index&blockchain[]=WAX&page_size=12. We're ready to push it further when more titles are added.
