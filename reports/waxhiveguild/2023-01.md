Progress on NFTHive:
- Added a PFP Creator to our tools. The PFP creator allows collection owners to add lists of traits with odds, layers of images,
rules to avoid conflicts and create a drop with those. Purchasing those drops will randomize the traits on chain and create unique 
out comes for PFPs. The results are picked up by a minting tool that merges the uploaded layers and mints the NFTs into the buyers 
wallets. The tool was anticipated by our community and the first drop will go live by https://nfthive.io/collection/mrcleverarts testing it.
It needs to be stressed that this will be the first truly random on chain unique PFPs on WAX.
- Blends contract is done and being tested: https://testnet.waxblock.io/account/nfthiveblend
It will revolutionize blending on WAX as well. You can create recipes of custom tokens, templates, collection assets, schema assets
and get multiple results. You can get results from preminted pools, templates, random templates, tokens, etc. It's possible to 
determine what happens to blended assets: Some may return to the blender (functioning like a key ingredient), some may return to the
collection creator or any other desired account, some may be burned and some may be locked up in the new asset. 
It's then possible to break the new assets apart again and get the original assets out again by destroying the blended asset (burn it).
- Added multiple collection support to pack creator. Transfer assets to the pack contract and put them into pools regardless of being 
the collection owner. If you own the NFTs, you can create packs with them
- Added Trait Analytics for more PFP Projects. Each trait in a PFP project is now analyzed for it's rarity and the floor prices. 
Rankings are scored by industry standards. Added Ranking pages for PFPs, eg: https://nfthive.io/collection/mnstr.droppp?tab=pfp
Supported collection: theduckbutts, chainchampss, worldsofsmil, mindmastrart, bcbrawlers, gpknk.topps, lewdmomoko22, shiftybearsx, 
mnstr.droppp, vbots, morbsniftybc, dabitcoinkid, dropbearsnft, shnazzegirls, jrgtradecard, blackbergcmx
- Reworked notifications: Now notifying users about sold items, new trade offers, auction bids, new floor price listings for favorited
assets, new drops (atomic, nefty, nfthive) for favorited collections. Connected NFTHive notifications with the Telegram Bot

Progress on WAXMarketCap:
- Added UAL and login options
- Added Collection Voting and Ratings on Collection Pages

Verification Tool:
- Changed order of collections on https://verify.hivebp.io: Order is by number of votes instead of voting score. 
This way users stopped downvoting other collections in order for their collection to get ahead.
- Integrated collection voting on NFTHive and Waxmarketcap, eg: 
https://nfthive.io/collection/dbrokendollz
https://waxmarketcap.com/collection/dbrokendollz
- Released the contract open source: https://github.com/hivebp/verifystatus
- Tool started to get some traction in the community. We recorded 2218 votes and now have 250 collections rated. 
Lukas mentioned it a couple of times of a tool to integrate by others

Twitch Drops:
We developed a Twitch Drop Tool for WAX NFTs: https://twitch.hivebp.io/
Twitch has a built-in reward system that allows game owners to reward viewers of gaming streams to drop rewards for a
certain view time. It's up to the game creators what to drop. It could be achievements connected to their website, steam
or in our case: NFTs. For that, we connect wallets to Twitch User IDs. When a user logs in and connects their accounts,
we check the Twitch API for new rewards of the game they were watching. If we detect they have been rewarded for watching
Blockchain Brawlers for instance, we can drop NFTs to them. The challenge is to allow this tool to work for all games 
on WAX. For that it's required to set up some requirements on Twitch and create a drop on our site. This drop can 
be linked to a reward program on Twitch. Once the campaign is live and the drop set up, we drop NFTs as rewards automatically

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

A couple of months ago we got annoyed by the fact that creator tools on WAX are behind massive paywalls. We started our 
creator tools as a guild with the goal to make pack creation, blending, drops, premints and all freely available.
Here's what we think is a cause and effect of our decisions as our tools progress:
