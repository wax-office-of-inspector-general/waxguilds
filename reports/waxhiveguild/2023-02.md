All of our mainnet & testnet nodes have been upgraded to 3.1.x, with the exception of one of our three ship nodes, which currently still acts as a wax2.0 fallback for our hyperion. We will upgrade our hyperion and that last ship node by no later than the 10th of March.

Progress on NFTHive:

- Added the Crafting Tools (announced as blends in the last report). One of our most significant new features, the crafting tools allow for unprecedented crafting mechanisms on the WAX blockchain. The UI fully supports all the features the contract has to offer, and it has already been embraced by our community. We were already able to iterate and improve it based on the feedback we got. Crafts can be found at https://nfthive.io/crafts, collection owners can access the tools to create crafts via the new "Manage Crafts" option at https://nfthive.io/creator. As of February 28th, 20 crafting recipes are currently live, and 247 crafting actions have been performed.
- The PFP Creator has been updated and enhanced. It is now easier for the user to see which layers are being used and which combinations are possible. We now also render an immediate preview of the generated PFP, but delay the actual minting of the NFT by two minutes, in order to avoid "wrong mints" when forks may occur. We also enhanced the PFP Creator tools with some quality of life fixes suggested by our community.
- WAX Cloud Wallet integration has been updated to support mycloudwallet. Then it has been removed again, because it's buggy and users report not being able to login with their email/passwords. To be continued...
- Added the option to log in with an ORE ID Wallet.
- The HONEY token has been drained and was basically rendered worthless after a criminal found an exploit in one of the actions of the nfthivevault contract. Upon discovery, we immediately notified our community, asked all major exchanges to blacklist the token and have since issued a new HONEY token which replaces the old one. All HONEY holders received the same amount of the new HONEY token as they held before the attack, and we refunded their lost liquidities in WAX. We also published a new HONEY site: https://nfthive.io/honey. The total supply of Honey has been reduced from 1B to 10M.
- Added AI & NSFW Filter
- Added Bulk Auctioning and Bulk Swapping from Simpleassets to Atomicassets
- Supporting Pepperstake staking by showing staked Assets and allowing unstaking them

Metrics:

- 1495 Buyers, 681 Sellers, 770.7K WAX / $58.9K Volume in the last 30 days on Secondary Market Sales
- 560 Buyers, 308 Sellers and 137.6K WAX / $10.8K generated for WAX Creators in the last 30 days on Drops
- Ca $2070 in Cpu Renting Fees in the last 30 days

Twitch Drops:
There have been 856 claims for Blockchain Brawlers Twitch Drops using our tool. We are trying to onboard other WAX projects, as well, among others The Forge Arena, however twitch has turned out to be rather restrictive and slow when it comes to whitelisting games and giving developers the required access to their own games. We are trying to help these projects as best as we can.

Verification Tool:
- Has been updated according to feedback from Neftyblocks here:
