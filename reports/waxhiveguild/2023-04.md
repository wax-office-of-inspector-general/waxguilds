Progress on NFTHive:

- Added ability to craft NFTs from ingredients with different base image layers. This allows creators to write recipes where an outcome is a composition of the layers of the ingredients, eg characters with different hats, facial features etc.
- Finished Ore ID wallet support. ORE ID is a custodial much like the WCW, with the difference that the login only works for the specific dapp and the dapp pays for the account creation. This allows us to onboard users and give them their first NFTs. Later they can move on to create an anchor or WCW account. 
- Added major utility for HONEY tokens, by giving stakers a 33% share of the market fees. We're seeing a significant token value and market volume increase after this
- Every PFP Drop is automatically added to PFP trait analytics and shows a ranking below the drops, giving users more incentives to buy, see https://nfthive.io/drop/nfthivedrops/2784 
- Updated Drop Layout (see above), asset layout (https://nfthive.io/asset/1099857915098), listing layout (https://nfthive.io/listing/atomicmarket/113891355), collection layout (https://nfthive.io/collection/dnd.funko) and more!
- Adding auto select ingredients to the crafting tool
- Added Redeemable NFTs to the creator tools. These NFTs will be redeemable via that redemption protocol that we're assisting Re:Dreamer with
- Added Crafting Animations. Creators can now add preview animations to their crafting recipes when someone crafts an NFT
- We are working on a new database model fully based on Amsterdams wonderful chronicle tool. It will allow for an NFTHive API that can be hosted on different servers (just like the Atomic API), but it will include all drops, crafting, simpleassets, different market contracts, and the entire history of WAX NFTs.
