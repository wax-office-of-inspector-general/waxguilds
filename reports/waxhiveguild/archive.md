## Technical Operations

We’re producing blocks on WAX Testnet since June 1st. We lost some rounds in the beginning when we were still trying to figure out how to set up the producer properly, but it’s been stable since then. It has now been 14 days without lost rounds or blocks.

We’ve registered on Mainnet on June 7th and are already reporting to the delphioracle.

We have a Hyperion that is available at wax.hivebp.io.We have an Atomic API that is available at atomic.hivebp.io.

Api node is setup at https//api.hivebp.io/v1/get_info

We run an IPFS node for WAX NFTs, which is currently open for public use: https://ipfs2.hivebp.io, eg:https://ipfs2.hivebp.io/ipfs/QmYibAHZTEa9uuW3atMqjiGdejqb29MkDA7cVFQhyLG3RN

## Product Development

**NFTHive.io** Formerly WAXplorer.com, NFTHive has been in development since February 2020 and started out as a market explorer on top of simplemarket with better search indexing. Soon after that several marketplaces emerged, such as waxinventory, gpk.market, shatner.market, collectibles, morevgo.com and waxstash.com. We integrated them into our tracking and search engine and became the first cross market explorer on WAX.

To this day we keep this purpose in mind. After the launch of atomicassets, we combined all available marketplaces and asset standards into one search engine. Even swapped GPK cards are treated as the same asset on our platform, which enables retaining their entire trading history.

Our search tool enables a lot of unique search functions across all markets: Filter by author, name, mint numbers, price, price range, aether production rate and many collection specific attributes such as mining power for alien worlds, health, bag space, attack, defense for dark country, borders, colors and types for KOGS, Land Location for Uplift World etc. Sort by mint, price, aether rate, price difference and many more things. Find duplicates, missing items, ultra rare assets etc.

Additionally we are able to provide statistics over all markets and collections/authors. We also track pack and drop sales, making NFTHive the most complete source on Volumes on WAX.

Another Feature is our Set Builder Tool, a tool that helps collectors complete and check their collections. But compared to other set tools, we do not only track what users have in their inventory, but also when they a) stake it on rplanet, b) put it up for auction on waxarena and atomicmarket, c) list it on simpleassets markets or d) stake their KOGS in a tube. We also use a complex set matching logic, which compares suitable attributes (eg same rarity, border, color, frame, variant, etc). Currently we are supporting 68 collections with Sets.

Our Bulk Tool offers a lot of NFT operations in bulk, such as transfer, burn, stake (to rplanet), sell, buy, bundle, sell duplicates etc. You can use it for up to 400 assets at the same time.

In the past 30 days we had unique 3700 traders and a volume of 2.5M WAX, making NFTHive the second largest marketplace in the WAX ecosystem. This does not include the referrals we offer to other marketplaces.

We are not able to track how many actions are done with the Bulk Tools in total for staking, burning, etc, but based on the Feedback, we know that they’re very popular. We can also see that 200k assets were bulk transferred and 3729 Assets distributed (transferring assets to different wallets, for example for giveaways etc, etc) in the last 30 days alone.

**HIVE-E Telegram Bot** is a bot to track new market listings. With the help of our tracking tool, we can announce new listings on any marketplace for any asset type. To make this more useful, we only announce when an asset is listed below the current market price based on our statistics. The bot also allows users to follow collections to get announcements of new drops, which includes both atomicdropsx and neftyblocksd drop contracts. So far, 10000 assets are being tracked.

## Ecosystem Development

Running an increasingly popular platform and data resource, we have helped several projects grow and get exposure. We also provided technical help.

Some examples are providing snapshots of collectors to Blockchain Heroes, Ultra Horrors and The Uplift World. Those were the foundation for several airdrops and prizes, for instance the Yoshi Coin drop which happened in collaboration with the Uplift World.

We ran several banners for new drops for Misfits, Hodlgod, Dust and Blood, Dr. Zammsy, Fantasy Art and many smaller collections for free.

We are also running several sales feeds, for example the GPK Sales feed with 127 subscribers at [https://t.me/NFTSalesFeed](https://t.me/NFTSalesFeed), Blockchain Heroes Sales Feed, Dark Country Sales Feed, KOGS Sales Feed and the >$100, >$1000 and >$10000 Sales Feeds on the official WAX Discord.

## Community and Marketing

Our Telegram group is a busy place for our users and befriended collections to share drops and promotions and talk about features requests. We’re constantly keeping an eye out to support the community with any problems they might run into. It now has 650 members:[https://t.me/NFTHiveTalk](https://t.me/NFTHiveTalk)

We also run a Discord Server, which is much younger, but serves a similar purpose and is growing quickly:[https://discord.gg/y47qvSmaVu](https://discord.gg/y47qvSmaVu)

Our Twitter has 6600 followers and we constantly share WAX News, Collection Announcements as well as run giveaways. Often we just promote collections because we like them and found rare assets on the market. The latest giveaways were in collaboration with Luminaya Crypto:[https://twitter.com/nfthiveio/status/1397249436422742023](https://twitter.com/nfthiveio/status/1397249436422742023)It achieved 17000 impressions and 1600 engagements.
