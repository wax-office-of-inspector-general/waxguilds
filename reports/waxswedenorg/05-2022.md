## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
- We have been working closely with other guilds to figure out and try to solve the p2p issues that exist onchain. There has been missing transactions, which we try to resolve.
- We have built and provided the latest releases of mandel for WAX.
    - These releases should improve the stability for transactions
- We have been working on improving internal and external p2p
- We are currently setting up a new Datacenter, we have started to move hardware and test it out. One reason for this is that one of the DC we use currently have been experiencing a lot of issues lately, where we lose power and internet access, which shows on the API data. In the power issues we have also lost machines, they crashed, as well as multiple drives. We have replaced majority already, upgraded other machines with more RAM and drives, as well as ordered another machine.
- We have updated our internal dashboard with additional features to overview and monitor our p2p, history and api infrastructure.

- We hosted a tournament in The Forge Arena, this event took a lot of time to organize and run, but it was totally worth it. A lot of community members got to enjoy the game and we had great sponsors from many existing guilds and projects on WAX. It really was a nice event that brought together the whole community.
