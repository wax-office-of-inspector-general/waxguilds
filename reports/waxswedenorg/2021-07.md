## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

- We have been researching and figuring out where requests get stuck in the API pipeline
as well as made optimizations for it to reduce problems for users.
- We have upgraded our load balancer to better deal with the bursts DAPPs have when requesting data.
- We have created better caching system through varnish that will improve the user experience of our public API
- We have helped multiple projects locate and fix issues with their DAPPs when it comes to how it utilizes the WAX chain and API's.
A lot of the DAPPs are not aware how eosjs and modules operate and they perform a lot of requests that are not required.
At bursts of users this has resulted in large amount of repeating requests similar to a ddos attack.
- Set up more push-api nodes behind the load balancer to handle the load
- We are directing a lot of hours of work towards further optimizations of elasticsearch and hyperion

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

- Read out API updates, this is helping new and existing DAPPs to achieve a better experience.
  - We are currently working on optimizing the open API and as soon as the next stage is done we plan to add special access for DAPPs that give them a higher reliability and better ratelimiting.
  - Once we are ready we will publish a blogpost with details, currently we are frequently tweaking settings.

- The Anyobservation channels are continuing to educate, inform and entertain the WAX community and those outside looking in.
 - Every week we get NFT creators reaching out and thanking us for creating WAX content and tutorials to help with onboarding.
  - We can go through DMs and provide this info on request. But rather not share private conversations publicly.

During the WAX IG election we tried to inform and engage more users from the community and participate in the voting.


## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?

The IG election website need to be improved upon. The user flow is rather bad, it's hard for a new person to understand it.
Would also be great to have an WAX IG website with all the reports and updates from guilds as well as a summary from the IGs with the biggest things being worked on each month.
