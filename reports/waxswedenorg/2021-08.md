## What is the name of your Guild?

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

- We have spent time on the RAM situation of WAX. Trying to figure out risks and benefits of adding a ram inflation to WAX.
We believe it is important to discuss through all the potential issues that could come from ram inflation, and how to solve them before they arrive.
Potentially that can lead to avoiding all problems that could emerge.

- We continue to put in time on our API infrastructure. We have a constant high load on our API from Alienworlds and other successful dapps.
For this we are reworking our ratelimiting structure, upgrading hardware, optimizing machines and moving nodes around.
We believe we will have a more reliable experience in not to long time.

This continues to be the area where we put in the most work hours.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

- We have been maintaining our products.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

- We are still not ready to publish our testings of ratelimiting of our API, and is continuing the work and monitoring the results.
Our goal is to create a service that is as freely as possible, yet can deal with the high load we have experienced lately.

- We continue to partake in discussions, education and assist DAPPs and community members of WAX.
We would love to hear from the community if there is any tutorials we should create on WAX, in video or text. Aimed at community and beginners to more easily understand how everything works.

- In the process of running Alienworld teleport oracles we are putting in a lot of time in optimizations in regards to WAX, and we are using that information and knowledge to provide better services over time for the WAX community.

- We have published an update on our website: https://waxsweden.org/july-sw-eden-update/
