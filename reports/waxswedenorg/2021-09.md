## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

- We continue to get high pressure on our Public API's and are working on adding more capacity. We are preparing a second full Hyperion Cluster to manage that bottleneck, as well as creating another scaling solution. Hopefully the first part will be ready by the Beginning of October.
- We are continuing to tweak and test our ratelimit to allow for users to interact with the DAPPs and projects that utilize our API, while at the same time not allowing them to spam down our API.

We have noticed that running public API's for WAX is requiring more and more time, resources and effort, so a majority of our time is being directed here.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

- We are currently building out an educational platform. This is to help onboard and educate users in a nice way.
So far, I don't think we have any great and easy to digest portal or gateway for users to find all information they need to understand the basics. Currently this is still under development and we don't want to share it publicly. But I have shared it in direct message to the IG's to be informed of what we are building.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

- We are currently working on community engagement activities in both Alienworlds and TheUplift.world by doing events together with other teams and collections.
- We have a full blocklog available in our snapshot directory. 382G for people to recover when something goes south. http://snapshots.waxsweden.org/snapshots/57abfa/2.0/wax_blocks_20210916.tar.gz
- We have high hopes that our educational platform can be a stable in educating the ecosystem in WAX, both for new and existing users.
