### The Academy
- The softlaunch of the first course on the academy is now public, It's a soft launch because there are still a few aspects to add before it's fully launched. That includes details on the WAX Defi model, wax governance and a few other higher level items. As well as video walkthrough of multiple of the lessons for people to understand it more easily.

22 lessons published, 5 unpublished, and more content on the way.
