- We have built a new internal monitoring system for all our infrastructure.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### The Academy
- We have continued to work on the Introduction to WAX course. This has been greatly appreciated by community members and the WAX team themselves. Over the last month we have gone into the material and reworked parts, as well as adding more content. We have still not officially launched it or pushed it ourselves.
So far we have 1.7K visitors and 3.6K views, which means users are coming back for the information.

This Academy is to be seen as a good source of references for users, community managers and projects to help educate and on board new users. Each lesson can be shared individually as their own article.

This product has required a big portion of our content creation over the last months.
We still have more unpublished courses that we are working on simultaneously.

### Commercial API & Notification service
We have developed a system for reliable Notifications for DAPPs and projects to tap into instead of operating their own WAX Nodes. We also offer access directly to SHIP nodes in case they want to build on top of it themselves. Since we have years of experience operating WAX Infrastructure, this is a highly reliable service for teams to utilize instead of hiring more personnel.

### Token Teleport Oracle Service
This is a product we have been running and developing in the background for the last year. We are currently operating token oracles for both Alienworlds and RFOX. Now we are also opening up this service for other projects to tap into to bridge the gap cross blockchains.
