## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

- We have optimized the performance of our API infrastructure, now handling a higher constant level of requests from the community.
- We now see an avg around 100k requests per minute, with an avg response time of 0.019-0.06s depending on call, to our WAX API Infrastructure.
- Out of all these calls, with this, we have increased how many requests you can do, depending on which call you do, and how well our back-end handles that.
- This has resulted in far less IP's being blocked and rate-limited than before. Now it is mainly spam, or those that do big bursts in a short time-frame.

### This is data between 24th of Feb and 28th of Feb

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
We have observed some of the tools used to test infrastructure of the guilds have been reporting our infrastructure as failing.
This is not replicated when we go back and look at our API data. We are in communication with the providers of these tools to figure out why.
I don't think, and hope you are not,solely rely on these tools to rate guilds, but also do manual testing.
