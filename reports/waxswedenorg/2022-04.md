## What is the name of your Guild?

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
- We have been working on redoing all internal peering, as well as getting dedicated peering with multiple guilds for transactions and for blocks. To improve reliability and reduce potential issues users may experience.
- We have been spending a lot of time trying to understand why, where and how transactions fail, and how we can work on reducing that on all stages of our infra as well as all wax infra. One is testing the new subjective-account-decay feature.
- We have been doing physical maintenance on a bunch of our dedicated hardware. Something that we will continue working on, and it should not affect our products.
- We had issues with DDOSing over the last month, same as many guilds. Our new setup proved to be very reliable in these situations.
- We have been researching and testing new infrastructure to be ahead of the current growth of the WAX network.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?
- We have been working on creating scripts and tools to help users get and format their transactions required to do their taxes. This has proven to be rather difficult for a lot of users that has many million of transactions to sort through. Our team has acquired the wax.tax domain and long-term goal is to host a rather self-sufficient service that help users get their p2e, nft and wax data for tax purposes.

### The Academy
- Been working on the new courses and materials. Hope to publish at least one of them by next IG update.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
- We add all the latest releases to our apt repo - https://eosswedenorg.github.io/apt/wax/bionic
- We have been helping multiple community members to get a summary of all their transactions for 2021 for tax purpose. Something we have been doing while we build out the wax.tax, more on that mentioned above.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
- We are organizing and hosting a community event. Which is a Tournament on The Forge Arena which is a really exciting game with NFTs on WAX. For this tournament we have brought in sponsors from multiple guilds and NFT projects and hope to help them reach new eyes.
This tournament is a passion project and something we are very excited for, we are all gamers by heart and happy to see such a progressive game on WAX. The tournament is on 29th of April and we will continue to put a lot of time and energy towards this event.


April update on website, with some graphs and other fun.
