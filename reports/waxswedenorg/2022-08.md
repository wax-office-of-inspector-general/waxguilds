## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
A bunch of the links below are helping and leaving an impact in the ecosystem. 
During the issues that has been present for the last few days, we have been trying to dig into the why, and the how it's possible, and find different solutions that could help solve it for the future. We have also been trying to communicate the situation with the community in different forms, to keep them as informed as we can at this stage. This month guild update focuses entirely on trying to explain the entire Node Operator system and how the situation affects it. Also made two graphs, one simple, and one complex on the node setup(s). With hope to add help for people to understand.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
- The current situation on WAX require a lot of tech knowledge and incentive to put time into investigating, digging through logs and continue to do so when it's hard to identify all aspects of the situation and come up with ideas to solve it. The current OIG rating system incentivises the opposit, where it's do the minimum on tech, while still passing the line, and put all focus outside of the infra operation. 
- This has lead to a lack of engagement over the issue that has been ongoing for the last few days on WAX
- I hope we can find a way to figure this out in a good manner.
