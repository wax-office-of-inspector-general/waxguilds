- The tool is a product, but it's also to help and benefit the ecosystem to help users moving forward.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?
- The Neftyblocks event was a success, although rather small event, we are certain it will have a positive ripple effect for many projects and teams outside of those that attended. The athmosphere and feeling of the event was great.
- We helped a small project (waxdao) get some more eyes: https://youtu.be/gwEF3iSep9s 
- A few livestreams with different figures in the ecosystem. More incoming.
- For the next update, the livestreams should also be available in podcast Audio format.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
- As stated on Telegram, We think that the scoring for Full history is not aligned with the requirements and costs of running it. 
- If we would shut down our Full history, and start up two lightweight services, we would save a lot of cost and maintenance, yet keep the same tech score. 
- We will not do that as of now, It is however an issue of the scoring system that is worth highlighting, where it's about Quantity rather than Quality services. 
- The main problem is likely the same as always, how do you objectively validate a service without asking for data that can be manipulated or be unfair in other ways.
- But the OIG need to put time into figuring out how to guide the chain in a sustainable way, we have seen before what happened on other chains (e.g. EOS) when there was little to no incentive to run Full History API's, and it ended up being 2 players for most part, and when one had issues, only 1 Full History API existed.
