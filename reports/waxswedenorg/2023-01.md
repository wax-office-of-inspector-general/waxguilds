### Testnet
- The testnet upgrade for Antelope has been finished, We put in a large chunk of our effort in the last while to help migrate old EOSIO contracts and get the WAX repo up to speed. Great work together with Aaron from the WAX team to make this happen. 
- We forked the WAX testnet and set up a stage-net and invited the upgrade team to test all upgrades and make sure all is smooth.
- Another full Block backup of testnet: https://snapshots-cdn.eossweden.org/wax-testnet/leap-3.1/wax-testnet_blocks_2023-01-09T14_13_00_621_194779630.bin.tar.gz

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
- Continued to work on wax.tax, primarly focused on building the backend to be more efficient
- A lot of work is done on alienw.com, which is a portal to help the Alienworlds community follow the syndicate events.
    - The work on alienw.com trickles over to the work required for wax.tax, so they go hand in hand in a few areas. 
- New Database is set up, and rewritten a lot of the code for alienw.com, and started to do that for wax.tax as well in the last week.
    Already rebuilt most of the code used to fetch and store historical price data.
