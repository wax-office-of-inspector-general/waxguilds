## What is the name of your Guild?

waxswedenorg

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
- We are Ready for Mainnet Antelope Upgrade
    - We have successfully upgraded all relevant WAX nodes to Antelope and are ready for the Mainnet upgrade
        - Except the Snapshot node, which will continue to push 2.0 Snapshots for as long as possible, to enable potential reverse at as late date as possible if required. 
            - Since 2.0 is compatible with 3.0, but 3.0 snapshots is not compatible with 2.0 nodes
- We have added some new drives to our WAX hyperion cluster
- We have created new scripts and indexing patterns for WAX nodeos logs into elasticsearch
    - Goal is to improve the data to use for figuring out the cause of chain problems
- The new data has been used to create more overviews and scripts to be used while investigating onchain events
- We were active in finding the applicable fix for the latest abuse contracts on WAX

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?
- We are actively developing a tool to help Guilds, and other WAX Node operators
    - The tool will help track potential issues with producers
    - It will allow any guild to set up their own notifications for the data they find relevant
    - The Data for general WAX Node operators will be slightly different, as it will likely be used as a source of information when they notice issues, rather than as a tool to mitigate issues in their setup. 
    - The data from our internal testing has been shared in the guilds channels to help figure out issues and patterns. 
    - [x] Smart Contracts are developed
    - [x] Smart Contracts are deployed on Mainnet (account: notify.se)
    - [x] Notification backend is done and operational
    - [x] Website UI to help create and manage the notifications for users
        - The UI will help to encrypt the sensitive data, and formatting the transaction for the user. Alpha UI has been shown to OIG member.
        - [x] Cleos integration
        - [ ] Cloud wallet integration
        - [ ] Anchor integration
        - [ ] FAQ on how the tool works and how to use it
    - [ ] Presenting the public chain information
        - We have not fully decided how to best move forward, few open options
        - It was not the initial intention to build a public tool, but rather a way to help guilds to get a 3rd party view on their setup.
        - However, Access to relevant data is requested by node operators during the latest onchain abuse.
    - [ ] Deploy the website
    - We are further on our GO ship reader and redis solution

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
- With alienw.com and being active in the Alienworlds Syndicate, we have helped new projects in the ecosystem fund their ideas and continue development, or create new projects in this market. 
    - alienw.com has helped the syndicates to present and track all proposals
    - One of our team members is an active participant in the AW Syndicates

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?
- The merging of pull requests to the git repo seem to be doing something strange, which creates conflicts on our repo.
    - Not a huge issue, we can handle it on our side. But would be cool if looked at.
