## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
- The last period has been rough, one of the Datacenters had a 6 hour power outage, and after that we have experienced a bunch of issues.
  - Drives gave up, CMOS battery had to be reset on another machine, and history backups not properly replaying.
  - These issues are now resolved.
- We have been spending a lot of time investigating the reasons some blocks keep having low transaction counts across the chain.
  - We have tried to find patterns, and reasons behind the situation, to see if we can find more best practices for how to improve this moving forward
  - We have an initial idea for one way to mitigate it, but before we present it to the Antelope team, we want to disect it and see if we find flaws, so we don't waste their time.
    - One of the bigger problems is that some automated contracts don't mind spamming failing transactins, because there is no penalty for that.
    - Some teams have suggested, or implemented a blacklist system on some of their nodes, or all of them, for spammy contracts, which is not a long-term solution.
