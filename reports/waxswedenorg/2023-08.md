## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
- Spent a lot of time investigating the current 0 transaction block situation and figure out what the reason(s) for that can be. 
- Building ways to dig into the CPU transaction data more efficiently. The idea is to find the most efficient and practical way to share this with the community and guilds, to get CPU data which is actually representing real on-chain information. 
	- Currently we look at the most used contracts and actions, then break down the CPU used to process that action for each BP. We look at total actions, inline actions, Median CPU time, Average CPU time, Max CPU time and Minimum CPU time for each of these actions. Then we can compare these numbers with the Average across all BPs. Providing interesting real world data.
	- We can clearly see that the CPU data from eosmechanics isn't necessarily a fair representation of real world results. And some Guilds are more efficiently executing some actions, compared to others. This is likely due to the Processor used, as well as configuration. 
	- If we present this data in the wrong way, assumptions might be made which incorrectly and unfairly criticizes a specific Guild. Numbers don't lie, but understanding the bigger picture is more difficult. 
- We have upgraded majority of all our nodes to Antelope 4>
	- We keep some nodes on lower versions to reduce risk of any potential issues from running all nodes across the same versions
