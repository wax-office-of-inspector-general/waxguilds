## What is the name of your Guild?

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?
- New machine for load balancing the API
- Upgraded Hyperion versions on all our hyperion APIs
- New Machine for Mainnet Producer
- Spent more time on digging logs for reasons why we, and other teams saw low transaction blocks. Seems to be a combination of reasons. Hard to test all ideas when situations are not always the same. Got notes, but looking for more final info on any main reason. Has shared with other guilds. 
- Had a short outage of our Full History (2023-10-14) when there was a big power outage caused by a thunderstorm so both the main and backup fiber connection went down. In the meantime, the backup was accessible. The Chain API should be working normally.
- Our Infra has required more than normal amount of maintenance and service of hardware, so that has taken a lot of the teams time and energy.

Few others in the works, but nothing public yet.
## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?
- Worked on improving alienw.com and the tools surrounding that. Enabling more tools, teams and products built on WAX to be part of the AlienWorlds DAOs and get funding to support them through these bear markets. That also includes helping and guiding teams and developers how to build applications using the WAX account system and other features. 

- We have also seen more teams struggling during the bearmarket, and have taken a few calls and long text based discussions on ways to get through this, and how/if we can assist in some way. 

- We still run the Alien Worlds Oracle Teleport service for users to teleport TLM between BSC < > WAX < > ETH
