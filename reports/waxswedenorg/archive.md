We have had hardware crashing and the work to fix that has been a big focus.

We rebuilt our delphi oracle script, where we are using more sources for our price feed.

We have also added 150 more open connections to our p2p

Testing zram for state to see if we can have wax run smooth on less ram.

New internal reports on WAX infra to better track infra across our setup and WAX network in general.

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

## May 2021

**Tech operations:**

- Continued to scale according to the growth of WAX
- Made sure all our nodes are ready for growth
- Continued to work on our WAX API which is getting a lot of traffic lately thanks mainly to marketplaces and alienworlds.

This last month has required a lot of time to work on maintaining and operating our API infrastructure, at times we have seen many thousands of requests per second, I can share more numbers on that if asked in a DM.

**Product development:**

- Keep adding the latest builds to our apt repo

Majority of time last month has been put into the tech and ecosystem development.

- We are slowly working on launching blokshop together with a partner, we have to clear all legal aspects of selling merch all over the world. But it's probably coming along soon.. hopefully.. Just information that a project exist and is on the way. No product in my eyes until it exists.

**Ecosystem Development**:

- With the increased growth of usage on our API we have been working hard to maintain and help services stay afloat and deal with urgent issues.
- We have 0 news on the MXC exchange listing.
- Our guides and videos continue to onboard users and help them navigate WAX and secure their accounts.

**Community and Marketing**:

Anyobservation Youtube:

I can see that a lot of the basic guides are being reviewed and used to understand WAX for a new user. Screenshot on the top videos the last month and how many views they got.

**Anyobservation Twitter**:

**Anyobservation Twitch:**

Just reached Affiliate level on twitch to get some added perks etc on twitch. To reach yet another audience with WAX And NFT talks!

**Anyobservation medium:**

Thank you guys for doing all the work!

We keep our heads down and focus on updating and optimizing our API's and infrastructure. The added demand on our WAX infra is awesome and fun! But it requires time that we want to put into our other stuff.

Peace!

## April 2021

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

- We provided a PR to WAX to sort schedule by location, still not merged. [https://github.com/worldwide-asset-exchange/wax-system-contracts/pull/69](https://github.com/worldwide-asset-exchange/wax-system-contracts/pull/69)
- We have upgraded our loadbalancer for wax to increase capacity multifold. This was to make sure we can handle the load from MLB and AW.
- We have take a lead to onboard teams and help them set up wireguard for reliable, fast and secure peering.
- We have updated schedule ordering on testnet
- We have written new banning rules for spammers, something that has been growing fast on WAX.
- We have set up a new improved internal interface for our WAX API to better monitor and keep track of it.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?**

We are continuing to push all the latest releases to our apt repo

- The AW website is down under maintainance atm, and is being worked on.
- The anyobservation ecosystem is growing

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?**

- We are onboarding the MXC exchange together with wax eastern. We are responsible for the tech aspects and onboarding of the exchange, eastern is helping with translations and in lead of the communication. We are splitting the work 50/50. Here is one of the screenshots of the telegram chat. I don't want to add to much information in a mail, but I am happy to provide more if needed. So far I've helped them set up their nodes, created account on chain for testing, as well as provided them with some WAX to play with.

Now we are waiting for them for the next step.

- ------

During the last weeks we've helped onboard and answer questions for a lot of new users on twitter, youtube, telegram and discord.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?**

I have helped multiple projects reach a bigger audience within and outside of the WAX ecosystem.

We also held and AMA together with wax eastern for the chinese community, something we plan to do again soon. We intended to do it as a livestream on bilibili, but had API issues, and ended up having to do it at zoom. Was about 50 people in the call, but many had issues joining because they had never used zoom before. I was supposed to record it but missed doing that.

**Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form?**

## March 2021

## Technical Operations

We have further optimized our API infrastructure to get rid of bottle necks.

## Product Development

We have the latest builds on our APT repo - [https://eosswedenorg.github.io/apt/wax/bionic](https://eosswedenorg.github.io/apt/wax/bionic)

## Ecosystem Development

Actively working with NFT creators and smaller projects answering questions and providing directions and tips to move forward. Including but not limited to clashdome, awstats, and waxstash.

This is done over Telegram, twitter and discord. Many conversations are done in DMs and can not be shared. But our WAX API is supporting multiple sites, services and dapps central in the WAX ecosystem.

Dappradar, awstats, waxstash, clashdome, nfthive and many more services are utilizing our API infrastructure.

With the attendance at DYGYCON and Anders AMA on wechat, we have got in contact with new prospects for WAX. But so far it is to early to say if it will lead to anything.

## Community and Marketing

Stats for anyobservation:

**Youtube**: IG got the data

**Twitter:IG got the data**

Our Alienworld tools: [aw.anyo.io](http://aw.anyo.io/), is getting more and more traction.

Peace!

## February 2021

**Tech updates:**

We have further increased our capabilities of our hyperion API by upgrading our backend. In our tests this has shown to be a lot more stable. We now utilize 10gbps between our nodes which can better handle all traffic.

We have been working on figuring out the fault that put a lot of the API nodes under water, and together with other operators we have discovered that it is likely due to nodes having the: enable-account-queries pluginWe have activated Trace API to help dappradar track the WAX DAPPs and unload Pink's api's.

**Product development:**

We have been running multiple tests on the WAX testnet to help figure out if we are able to reproduce the errors that happened on WAX Mainnet. This is no longer needed until the new patch has been applied and we can see if it works in production.

**Ecosystem Development**:**WAX OIG interviews:**

- We've helped spread the information about the IG candidates and the work they do, why it is important and so forth.

**High quality API:**- Adding the Trace API for dappradar- Improving our Hyperion API infrastructure for the DAPPs utilizing it. **Anyobservation**

- Pushed a lot of content on Youtube and Medium**Community:**

## January 2021

**Ecosystem development:-**

We have built tools and helped smaller and bigger NFT projects to have easy to access data for a better overall user experience.

E.g.

[aw.anyo.io/planets](http://aw.anyo.io/planets)

E.g.

[https://aw.anyo.io/horrors/pack_open](https://aw.anyo.io/horrors/pack_open)

**Tech update:**

- We have published new full backup of blocks on Mainnet and Testnet.We have enabled trace API to help dappradar and are currently working on optimizing it for load to help the WAX chain.

Usefull API's (yeye, 0 points, but still for criteria):

- Hyperion for multiple dapps & sites
- Trace API for dappradar
- TOR api for privacy

**Community Update:**

- Opinion peace:

## December 2020

**We now have a TOR tunneled API service**

To better strengthen the people that want to interact with the WAX ecosystem we provide a public API through TOR to give the power back to the users.

More on this update will come in posts in the future, you can test it here:

[http://waxswedenex56rp5.onion/v1/chain/get_info](http://waxswedenex56rp5.onion/v1/chain/get_info)

Keep in mind it is a bit slower at responding since all traffic is tunneled through TOR

**Releases on APT** We are providing the updates of the WAX EOSIO versions on our APT repo.

**Have continued to do a bunch of videos covering the WAX ecosystem and helping projects reach more users.**

These are the videos and livestreams put out over the last month.

**We have performed auditing and upgrade of the WAX testnet.**

This was done in stealth mode. Now we can set amount of standby BPs in rotation by an action on the eosio account. This will be great to rely on the OIG report.

**We have been helping and working closely with NFT projects to smoothen their experience.**

This is something Anders prioritize with his time and help projects with multiple aspects, this can easily be observed in their telegram and discord channels.

As well as helping users with small to bigger issues.

## September 2020

- ----------------------------------------- **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations criteria? Please provide details.This question is required.**  -- We have once again upgraded our API infrastructure, which we continue to do as soon as we learn something new, or buy another device.   Testnet and mainnet: - Snapshots nodes upgraded  - wax producer upgraded  - wax peers upgraded
- Updated bp.json to fit the new standards

------------------------------------------ **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development criteria? Please provide details.This question is required.** -- We are continuing to develop our marketing products, focusing on Anders Youtube channel. Building a natural channel for WAX projects to announce news and reach users in a short time period.   We have built a new productline in regards to NFTs where we offer services to mint larger quantities of NFTs as well as airdropping them to users. We have already worked with two different drops. [https://nfts.waxsweden.org](https://nfts.waxsweden.org/) - Tested airdrop to 1000 accounts with no issues on testnet.  I can provide a full list of new youtube videos if needed. But the list is long.

Here is some data:

- ----------------------------------------- **Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Business Development criteria? Please provide details.This question is required.** -- No further information, still waiting for listings on exchanges. Not sure why it has not yet happened.

------------------------------------------ **Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form? This question is required.** -- As I mentioned on telegram, I think there is a movement in the wrong direction with some of the OIG ratings. When teams are encourage to put forth low quality services to gain points rather than to provide higher quality services that differentiate.   Everyone providing API's and snapshot service that are not being used is not adding value to the ecosystem. Rather it is discouraging for teams that provide high quality services in those areas when the teams that just want to farm points get the same scoring for the lesser service.   This enables a team that just want to farm point to get closer to teams that try to provide services that are actually adding value. Which shows teams that do put in more effort, resources and money into their products that it is not encourage and to lower standards.   If the bar is low for gaining points, unless there is an additional differentiator for higher quality services, it will send the wrong message.   OIG may not directly choose elected guilds, but OIG choose elected guilds. The point system has to work for a long term goal of a healthy ecosystem where teams feel comfortable investing resoruces into products that adds value.   Raising the bar for teams is good, and it has to be done. There are many steps over the last year that has been positive, and some that has not been positive. Don't take this critique as if everything is wrong. Because it is not. Don't make the OIG scores into the same broken system as the educational system has turned out to be.

Peace and love <3 Thanks for your hard work taking feedback from a bunch of ideologists and proud teams that think highly of themselves.   

## August 2020

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations criteria? Please provide details.**

We always work on optimizing and tweaking our infrastructure.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development criteria? Please provide details.**

We have continued to optimize waxmedia.io to show quality content.This website is slowly growing into a hub for curated WAX content.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Business Development criteria? Please provide details.**

We are continuing the collaboration with WAX Eastern to onboard the Whalex exchange. We have been working on this over the last few months and This month we have put in more time. There has been a lot of questions on how they can solve the integration techincally and we believe they have everything they need. The last we heard they are just finishing up internal testings of their solution. This has required multiple days over the last month where Eric and Anders has answered questions and assisted in integration of WAX. This to help Whalex technical team understand the different alternatives on how they can efficiently list WAXP as a trading pair. Hopefully we can see this exchange live for traders in the near future. From our perspective it is now 100% completed. All needed is for whalex to actually hit the listing.

On top of this month, the whalex integration has required us to put in time since end of May, and it feels great that it should be done.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement criteria?**

Yes, we have published a few videos on anyobservations youtube channel. Including live sessions, interviews, tutorials and technical explanations.

## July 2020

**What is the name of your Guild?**

WAX sw/eden

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations criteria? Please provide details.This question is required. ***

We have done further work to optimize our API infrastructure. Bought some new machines to increase efficiency and capacity.

We also helped review and push the latest code update on the WAX testnet. Now we have standby pay and auto rotations.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development criteria? Please provide details.This question is required. ***

We are currently building out 3 products in the community side of things.Youtube channel, Podcast and [waxmedia.io](http://waxmedia.io/).**Waxmedia.io** is a curated WAX content hub, with quizzes and the long term plan is to make it a one stop shop for anything WAX related. The place we send people towards when they need to learn more. So we gather amazing content from other creators as well as creating our own. The plan forward includes, but not limited to:- Quizzes, educational and entertaining- FAQ, a knowledge hub- Guides, video and text tutorials on different aspects of the WAX ecosystem.We have started to talk to multiple other guilds on collaboration for this hub. Translating as well as creating content.**Youtube and Podcast**These are slowly growing, and the idea is to build a strong presence in ecosystem. Reaching people we do not yet reach by talking to people within and outside of our ecosystem.Since June 5th, when it launched, we have had 281,5h played content on youtube over 3600 views of the content.The WAX tutorials are frequently being shared in the telegram communities to help onboard new members. According to Youtube channel statistics we have reached 27,600 people, 4.3% clicked on the content and 1400 unique viewers.I provided screenshot of these numbers, I can showcase them further if needed.

**We have improved our GPK channels on telegram.**- The trade channel now shows more markets and improved data. (167 users)- The listings channels have better formatted data (42 users)

These GPK bots take a continious effort and are being worked on repeatedly.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Business Development criteria? Please provide details.This question is required. ***

We are currently consulting in the onboarding of multiple exchanges.Our expertise lays in EOSIO and WAX, where we help answer questions and clear out confusion.During the last month we have been working along side WAX eastern and a community member, Venice, to do this.We do not take a lead in these projects but we do put in time to gather, present information and keep an open dialog.

I can name these exchanges in private if needed, don't want to expose the exchanges until they list WAX.

One of the exchanges has been taken over by another team.One of these exchanges seems to be close to listing, but you never know.One of these exchanges has been forwarded to the WAX team to take a next step if they choose to.

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement criteria? Please provide details.This question is required. ***

Youtube, Podcast and content creation has been a major part of the last month. I would count these towards both products and marketing campaigns.

We have created two quizzes to help educate WAX members.

You can also see(from screenshot), that Anders (orcus) is putting a lot of time and effort in the WAX community on telegram.These numbers include administrating, assisting, and common discourse.

Since last update we have put out these articles for the Chinese community:

We continously provide up to date data on the WAX ecosystem in [https://t.me/waxdata](https://t.me/waxdata) (130 users)

Together with Josep (blocks.barcelona) we created an WAX NFT community on telegram.We hope to build this out in the coming months. Currelntly 68 users[https://t.me/waxiomarkets](https://t.me/waxiomarkets)
