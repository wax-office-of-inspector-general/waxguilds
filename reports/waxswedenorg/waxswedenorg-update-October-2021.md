- The Education platform is being worked on, but it takes way more time than anticipated. I will add some images to showcase progress.
Currently there are 20 lessons in the course, I've tried to divide up the topics best I can, and I will not be surpised i there will be closer to 30. Before all is done, I will also add video walkthrough of the chapters, and I try to keep them short and high quality so it's not to much details for people.
Progress on the big wax beginner course:
