1. DUST Auctions for game items, art, and collectables have been moved to our new Discord server: [https://discord.gg/ZgrZ8xRYZD](https://discord.gg/ZgrZ8xRYZD)

**Community Tools**

1. Our WAX Labs funded bot – Collectabot continues to evolve. We have recently implemented categories, added icons for all items, and are adding the option to display icons only. Collectabot allows Telegram users to view their inventory from any NFT set on the WAX blockchain and gets pinged thousands of times per day. It is now in use with four different WAX sets (DUST, Nifty Wizards, Alien Worlds, and Bitcoin Origins). Other sets have reached out to us to implement the bot with their set and integration is ongoing.

Collectabot on Discord is currently in beta testing and Collectabot Mobile is also in beta testing on both Apple and Android devices.

1. Nifty Cap – Our team released a new community tool called Nifty Cap. This site displays WAX NFT collection rankings by sales volume and is refreshed every 24 hours. The goal of the site is to provide more precise figures for WAX collections than sites that combine all NFT projects across many different blockchains.

1. Shyn Mobile Application – Shyn (pronounced shine) is an NFT Portfolio app that displays all your WAX AtomicAssets. It can track multiple wallets, calculate total portfolio value, display mint numbers, duplicate assets, and much more. It was recently highlighted by WAX on their official Twitter page: [https://twitter.com/WAX\_io/status/1425849557707943940?s=20](https://twitter.com/WAX_io/status/1425849557707943940?s=20)

1. Niftysets – Allows creation of a &quot;set&quot; of WAX AtomicAssets. The set can include any number of NFTs from any collection. The user gives the set a name, uploads a cover image, chooses the NFTs to include, sets the price and clicks &quot;create&quot;. This new NFT can then be transferred or sold on Atomic Hub. When the NFT is burned, all NFTs inside are then transferred to the wallet that burned it.
