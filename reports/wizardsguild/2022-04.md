_**New Information:**_ 

* On April 2nd, 2022 Nifty Wizards held their first “Mini Battle Royale” where anyone with the required NFT’s in their WAX wallet were able to participate in a text-based battle to the death. The plan is to hold a Mini BR monthly and then bigger battles quarterly. The prizes for this battle were generously donated by a player. In total, 34 players registered and 21 showed up to play. A full description of the battle can be found here: [https://link.medium.com/enWbqoHiUob](https://link.medium.com/enWbqoHiUob).  And a rundown of the battle including detailed statistics can be found here: [https://link.medium.com/KbWQpiV1Vob](https://link.medium.com/KbWQpiV1Vob). 

The Goblin Bot mentioned in last months report is getting closer to being released into the game. The dev’s have added three different animations for when the goblin is killed, and if the rare animation is displayed, a rare Goblin Head NFT will be automatically sent to the player’s synced wallet. If it is not displayed, a non-transferable NFT will be sent to acknowledge the accomplishment along with a random Nifty Wizards NFT.

**Project 3: Waxstash Marketplace. [https://waxstash.com](https://waxstash.com) | [https://waxstash.io](https://waxstash.io)**

**Current Status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that Waxstash’s product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Both waxstash.com and waxstash.io are currently live, but separate, marketplaces. With waxstash.com supporting TLM and DUST sales, while waxstash.io provides more features but currently only supports WAXP.

**Progress:**
As planned waxstash.io was launched on schedule and presents several new features made possible by the Atomicassets standard and some unique features that are exclusive to waxstash. Notable features include:

*	Filters covering nearly every NFT schema/template/asset trait for each verified and whitelisted collection. For example, in regards to bcbrawlers Atomichub presents filters for Schema, Rarity, Variant, and CardId….whereas Waxstash presents Schema, Rarity, Variant, Champion, Hometown, Match Slots, and Packs, with each filter containing all the possible options for it that exist within a given collection.

*	Selected filters present “Chips” along with search results. Chips are analogous to breadcrumbs with each chip representing one of the selected filter options. Each chip presents the user with information regarding which filters are chosen and each chip can be clicked on to quickly remove that option and reload new search results.

*	Full NFT Marketplace, for listings, auctions, and history each independently searchable via the aforementioned filters.
	
*	NFT Explorer for collections, templates, and assets each independently searchable via the aforementioned filters.

*	NFT User Profile presenting a users inventory, current listings, current auctions, and sale history each independently searchable via the aforementioned filters.

*	Bulk tools for creating or managing up to 40 items at a time. Create 40 separate listings, auctions, or bundled assets in seconds, in WAX or pinned to USD. Users can also bulk edit up to 40 current listings at a time, with UI options to change the price or cancel each item in one transaction.

*	Transfer and Token view. A fast and convenient way to transfer NFTs independently or in bulk, and UI presenting an accounts owned tokens for transfer. Updates every 30 seconds.

*	An API picker that presents a notification to users if a slow or unresponsive API is detected along with UI displaying 8 default Atomic APIs and 8 default RPC APIs. along with each APIs current status, version, and speed. Users can select one of the default APIs that works best for them, or they can dynamically enter the URL of any API they wish to use, which will be added to the default API lists.

*	Navigation regarding the above features is managed independently behind the scenes for a faster and more fluid UX. For example, if setting filters and loading ‘Listings’ on the marketplace, and then switching to inventory and setting filters and loading ‘Inventory’ there, the status of each filter and result set is separate. So if user then switches back to ‘Listings’ the previous filters and ‘Listing’ results load instantly, and so on when switching back to ‘Inventory’ or any other feature, like auctions, history, or current listings.

**Next Milestones:**

*	Drops feature module. This will allow users to view, search, claim and but current Atomic and Neftyblocks drops, as well as present a UI for creating Waxstash drops.

*	NFT Creator module. UI for creating NFTs on the Atomicassets standard.

*	Customizable User Profile module.

* Project banners/ads module.

* All resized NFT images located on a worldwide CDN.

**User Metrics:**

* Waxstash.io and .com account for 804 Atomicassets sales across 330 unique users. Total sales volume of 34012.07623102 WAXP and 680 WAX contributed to DEFI.

*	Waxstash.com non-atomicassets sales volume was roughly 15,000 WAX for a total DEFI contribution of about 300 WAX.

**Project 4:NFT Pack Breaks. [https://packbreaks.io](https://packbreaks.io)**

**Current Status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that Packbreaks product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Packbreaks.io is currently live with a packbreak and a repack feature.

**Progress:**

* We held our planned WAX giveaway however due to lack of participation that giveaway was cancelled.

* Due to the Waxstash.io finalization and release we were unable to explore marketing strategies or a universal pack break. This will be pushed back.

**Next Milestones**

* Creating at least one repack containing top NFTs and will market that out through social media posts.

* Marketing & strategies to help users create valuable repacks that entice users to buy slots. We believe this is the number one reason few repack slots have sold.

* Universal Pack breaker. We have learned that users love packbreaks on newly dropped projects but that after the initial buzz of the new pack dies oﬀ, or most of the packs are opened, the pack breaker for that pack is largely unused. The next update packbreaks will get is a universal pack breaker, so new projects can be supported on the fly, and then turned oﬀ once the buzz dies down, and then the next project drop turned on and so on. The existing pack break contracts would be retired, to make room for packbreaks to be a universal breaker for newly dropped popular packs on one side, and the repack feature on the other. Packbreaks.io just received an update with the repack contract so the universal contract won’t be started at least until the initial version of waxstash.io discussed above is launched.

* Updating Packbreaks to use our new expansive trait filters.

**User Metrics:**

* Currently 30 Repacks are posted.
* A nominal amount of WAXP has been contributed to DEFI.
* Packbreaks have been silent and we expect they will be until we implement a universal pack breaker discussed in milestones that can be switched and used for newly dropped and popular packs.


**Project 5: Shyn NFT Portfolio Application**

Shyn (pronounced shine) is an NFT Portfolio application that displays all your WAX AtomicAssets. It can track multiple wallets, calculate total portfolio value, display mint numbers, duplicate assets, and much more. It was recently highlighted by WAX on their official Twitter page: [https://twitter.com/WAX\_io/status/1425849557707943940?s=20](https://twitter.com/WAX_io/status/1425849557707943940?s=20)

**User Metrics:**
Approximately 35 new downloads of the Shyn app occurred on the iOS platform during the current reporting period.
