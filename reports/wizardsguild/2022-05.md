**Wizard's Guild Updates – May 2022**

Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?

**Product 1: CPU Rental Service on the WAX Blockchain (new project) - [cpu.rent](https://cpu.rent/)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to an agreement between NiFTyLIFE and Wizardsguild it is intended that CPU Rental 
product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full.

**Progress:**
- Released a fresh CPU rental service located at [https://cpu.rent](https://cpu.rent) and funded with over 200k
WAX available for rent
- The only CPU rental service bringing utility to other tokens by accepting payments in WAX,
BRWL, TLM, TACO, and DUST
- Users have been using mostly WAX with the next most popular tokens used to rent CPU
being BRWL, TLM, & DUST
- Added noop action to pay for .wam account CPU when needed

**Next milestones:**
- Add support for other tokens as required or requested
- Support for renting CPU with NFTs

**Metrics:**
284+ rentals to date

**Product 2: Waxstash Marketplace. [https://waxstash.com](https://waxstash.com) | [https://waxstash.io](https://waxstash.io)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and Wizardsguild it is intended that Waxstash’s
product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Both waxstash.com and waxstash.io are
currently live, but separate, marketplaces. With waxstash.com supporting TLM and DUST
sales. Waxstash.io provides more features but currently only supports WAXP.
Waxstash.com will be merged with waxstash.io during this reporting cycle.

**Progress:**
Waxstash is fully operating with filters for nearly every NFT trait, an Explorer, user inventory,
token transfers, and an API picker.
- Since last report we have added free banners on waxstash and displayed banners for
multiple collections and events. We currently display a banner for bcbrawlers by default.
Each banner also contains a dropdown with more links to other helpful material regarding its
collection, such as tutorials, website, and links to quickly go to the market listings
- Added noop action to pay for .wam account CPU when needed
- Added a link on Waxstash to bring users to our CPU rental service homepage

**Next milestones:**
- Drops feature module. In development.
- NFT Creator module. UI for creating NFTs on the Atomicassets standard.
- Customizable User Profile module.
- UI for renting CPU built into waxstash, so users wont have to leave the marketplace to rent
CPU.

**Metrics:**
- Waxstash.io and .com accounted for 1,688 Atomicassets sales across 331 unique users. Total
sales volume was 19,900 WAXP and 398 WAX was contributed to DEFI.
- Waxstash.com non-atomicassets sales volume was nominal with less than 100
WAX contributed to DEFI.

**Product 3: NFT Pack Breaks. [https://packbreaks.io](https://packbreaks.io)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and Wizardsguild it is intended that Packbreaks
product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Packbreaks.io is currently live with a
packbreak and a repack feature.

**Progress:**
- Universal pack break smart contract is underway. This contract will be able to dynamically
support new packs as they are released and are popular. The contract will enforce criteria for
when a pack can be posted for a pack break, who can post, and when posted packs can be
undercut. In addition, the shuffling and order of slots will be on chain and will be done before
packs are opened.

**Next milestones:**
- Marketing & strategies to help users create valuable repacks that entice users to buy
slots. We believe this is the number one reason few repack slots have sold.
- Possibly new UI to go with the new universal pack break contract.

**Metrics:**
- Currently 33 Repacks are posted.
- A nominal amount of WAXP has been contributed to DEFI.
- Packbreaks have been silent and we expect they will be until we implement a universal pack
breaker discussed above.

5 new projects have added the DUST bot to mine DUST rewards while chatting in their room since our last report.

Three new project DUST Enhancers were released since our last report including Taco, Galactic 123, and NFT Sticker Co. A new 8-bit celebrity parody Enhancer was also released – Stealth Dawg.
