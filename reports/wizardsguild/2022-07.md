**Wizard's Guild Updates – July 2022**

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

We have installed new hardware to support a full history Mainnet Hyperion. It is now operational at https://wax-hyperion.wizardsguild.one/

**Product 1: CPU Rental Service on the WAX Blockchain (new project) - [cpu.rent](https://cpu.rent/)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that CPU Rental product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. CPU.rent has performed without issue since the last report.

**Progress:**
- The only CPU rental service adding utility to other tokens by accepting payment in WAX, BRWL, TLM, TACO, or DUST.
- Since release cpu.rent has performed ﬂawlessly and been growing in popularity and is funded with more WAX.
- Registered with boost.wax to cover CPU costs for users of cpu.rent and our other products.
- We spent several weeks working with other cpu rental services to combat accounts that use the rental services to spam various WAX accounts such as binance and other legitimate users. We developed an additional contract to support this - ban.stash - which maintains a list of banned accounts combined with in contract strategies that detect the suspect activity and then automatically ban the oﬀending account.

**Next milestones:**
- Add support for other tokens as required or requested
- Support for renting CPU with NFTs

**Metrics:**
- 2000+ CPU rentals to date accounting for nearly 500k WAX staked on behalf of user accounts.

**Product 2: Waxstash Marketplace. [https://waxstash.com](https://waxstash.com) | [https://waxstash.io](https://waxstash.io)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that Waxstash’s product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Both waxstash.com and waxstash.io are currently live, but separate, marketplaces. With waxstash.com supporting TLM and DUST sales, while waxstash.io provides more features but currently only supports WAXP. Waxstash.com will this cycle be merged with waxstash.io.

**Progress:**
Waxstash is fully operating with ﬁlters for nearly every NFT trait, an Explorer, user inventory, token transfers, and an API picker. Waxstash, its tools, and features have performed without issue albeit with lowered number of users since WAX stopped including waxstash as one of the markets listed with their NFT drops. We decided the drops feature we have been working on will be scrapped as there are drop features on Atomic, Neftyblocks, and NFTHive and another drops features simply won’t be needed in the space.

**Next milestones:**
- Integration with the new universal PackBreaks product.
- UI for renting CPU built into waxstash.
- Trace new collections to build their respective ﬁlters for every NFT trait in the collection. 

**Metrics:**
- Waxstash.io and .com account for 116 Atomicassets sales across 97 unique users. Total sales volume of 41,246 WAXP and 824 WAX contributed to DEFI.
- Waxstash.com non-atomicassets sales volume was nominal with estimated less than 100 WAX contributed to DEFI.

**Product 3: NFT Pack Breaks. [https://packbreaks.io](https://packbreaks.io)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that Packbreaks product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Packbreaks.io is currently in maintenance as we update the UI and integrate the new site with a new universal smart contract.

**Progress:**
- Universal pack break smart contract is complete and tested
- When listing a pack for a PackBreak users will be able to select a pack from their own inventory or are shown the lowest listed packs to buy. When buying a pack, it will be purchased from existing Atomicmarket listings and then automatically listed for a PackBreak in one transaction.
- Features enforced by smart contract:
  - Single contract allows admin to add or remove support for any packs on a rolling basis and allows all supported packs to exist in live PackBreaks simultaneously.
  - Users can list a PackBreak for any slot price, can lower slot prices as needed, and can cancel a pack after its live for a minimum of 1 hour and is not close to full. When a pack is cancelled or the slot price is lowered, slot owners automatically receive a full refund or a refund of the diﬀerence between the prices.
  - Users can ‘Takeover’ a live pack by listing their pack with a slot price at least 1% lower than the currently live pack. When this happens, the new pack absorbs any currently sold slots, slots owners receive a refund of the diﬀerence in price, and the replaced pack is placed in queue if there is space.
  - Users can ‘Call Next’ and place their pack in queue to be automatically listed when its their turn. To place a pack in queue there must be a currently live pack, and the queued slot price must be equal to the current slot price or up to 10% higher. Queued packs receive priority based on their slot price.
  - Each time a new PackBreak is listed it calls WAX RNG, generates a random number from the received hash, and uses this number to shuﬄe all slots together each time a slot is purchased. When the ﬁnal slot of a PackBreak sells, the smart contract calls WAX RNG once more, uses the new random number to shuﬄe slots once more and then posts the ﬁnal slot order on-chain. All this happens before the pack is opened.
Once that ﬁnal shuﬄe is complete and the ﬁnal slot order posted on chain, then the pack will be sent to its respective opener and opened. The order in which the NFTs are received by our smart contract determines the order they are issued to the slots. Some packs return bonus NFTs, ﬁllers, or otherwise may return more NFTs than there are slots for that pack, in this case those bonus NFTs are issued following the same policy above, in the order they are received, and will start at the slot ordered number #1, and then move on to slot #2, etc. until all bonus NFTs are issued.
  - Each time a PackBreak opens and issues the assets according to the above policies, the next pack will be automatically listed from the queue list, when available.

**Next milestones:**
- Final testing and launch new website
- Discuss with Funko the possibility of being able to support their packs. Currently they restrict pack opening and my contract would be unable to open Funko packs.
- Continue to manage the adding or removing support for packs

**New Information:**

A new quest was added to the game bringing the total to 22. It is entitled “All Hail the King” and to complete it, a player must kill whoever has the highest XP score three times before he kills you in the battle training room.

Three new spliff blends were released in July bringing the total available to 9. This increases sales of the various Weed NFT’s necessary to complete the blends as well as pack openings.

**Community Tools**

- Collectabot is used daily by players of Nifty Wizards and collectors of DUST Enhancer NFT’s. It was queried over 2.8 million times this month. Other projects have recognized the value of such a tool and have developed their own bots with similar functionality.

- [Nifty Cap](https://www.niftycap.com) – This site displays WAX NFT collection rankings by sales volume and is refreshed every 24 hours. The goal of the site is to provide more precise figures for WAX collections than sites that combine all NFT projects across many different blockchains. 

- Shyn Mobile Application – Shyn (pronounced shine) is an NFT Portfolio app that displays all your WAX AtomicAssets. It can track multiple wallets, calculate total portfolio value, display mint numbers, duplicate assets, and much more.
