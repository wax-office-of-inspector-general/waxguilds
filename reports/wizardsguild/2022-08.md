### **Product 1: WAX Blockchain CPU Rental Service - [cpu.rent](https://cpu.rent/)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that CPU Rental product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. CPU.rent has performed without issue since the last report.

**Progress:**
- The only CPU rental service adding utility to other tokens by accepting payment in WAX, BRWL, TLM, TACO, or DUST.
- Since release cpu.rent has performed flawlessly and been growing in popularity and is funded with more WAX.
- Registered with boost.wax to cover CPU costs for users of cpu.rent and our other products.

**Next milestones:**
- Add support for other tokens as required or requested
- Support for renting CPU with NFTs

**Metrics:**
- 2,866+ CPU rentals to date.

### **Product 2: Waxstash Marketplace. [https://waxstash.com](https://waxstash.com) | [https://waxstash.io](https://waxstash.io)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that Waxstash’s product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Waxstash.io is currently live.

**Progress:**
- Waxstash.com has been fully retired and now forwards to waxstash.io
- Updated filters for nearly every NFT trait
- We implemented a new image and video hosting CDN and automatic image resizing. This new automated flow ensures that new and updated projects or templates are continually checked, and their images/videos resized and then added to our CDN. This will result in faster loading times throughout all of our products.
- Waxstash features filters for nearly every NFT trait, an Explorer, user inventory, token transfers, and an API picker. Waxstash, its tools, and features have performed without issue albeit with lowered number of users since WAX stopped including waxstash as one of the markets listed with their NFT drops.

**Next milestones:**
- Integration with the new universal PackBreaks product.
- UI for renting CPU built into waxstash.
- Trace new collections to build their respective ﬁlters for every NFT trait in the collection. 

**Metrics:**
- Waxstash has 100 sales across 75 unique users. Total sales volume of 41,658 WAXP and 833 WAX contributed to DEFI.

### **Product 3: NFT Pack Breaks. [https://packbreaks.io](https://packbreaks.io)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that Packbreaks product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Packbreaks.io is currently live.

**Progress:**
-	Universal pack break smart contract is fully operational and integrated with packbreaks.io
-	Currently 18 Packs Supported: pr.funko premium, alegnd.funko standard & premium, jasb.funko standard & premium, hb.funko standard & premium, mlpony.funko standard & premium, musicmogul, hotwheels series 3, darkpinup act 2 collector box & pack, darkpinup act 1 collector box & pack, oddityparlor beloved pack, and mlb.topps standard & premium packs
-	We have added support for Atomichub’s and NFTHive’s pack openers. Although no packs from those openers have been added yet.
-	Synced with our global image hosting CDN
-	Changes were made to accommodate Funko x WAX packs. Since Funko restricts pack openings to only dp accounts logged into their website we had to create a manual opening flow for Funko packs. Everything operates the same as any other pack regarding listing, takeovers, queues, slot shuﬄes etc., except when a Funko pack slots sell out, instead of being opened by smart contract, the packs are instead sent to our dp account, where they are opened manually. The pulled NFTs are then sent back to our smart contract in the order they are received, where the smart contract continues with assigning the NFTs to the slots and airdropping them.

**Features enforced by smart contract**
-	Admin to add or remove support for any packs on a rolling basis
-	Users can list a PackBreak for any slot price, can lower slot prices as needed, and can cancel a pack after its live for a minimum of 1 hour and is not close to full. When a pack is cancelled or the slot price is lowered, slot owners automatically receive a full refund or a refund of the diﬀerence in price
-	Users can ‘Takeover’ a live pack by listing their pack with a slot price at least 1% lower than the currently live pack. When this happens, the new pack absorbs any currently sold slots, slots owners receive a refund of the diﬀerence in price, and the replaced pack is placed in queue if there is space.
-	Users can ‘Call Next’ and place their pack in queue to be automatically listed when its their turn. To place a pack in queue there must be a currently live pack, and the queued slot price must be equal to the current slot price or up to 10% higher. Queued packs receive priority based on their slot price.
-	Each time a new PackBreak is listed it calls WAX RNG, generates a random number from the received hash, and uses this number to shuﬄe all slots together each time a slot is purchased. When the final slot of a PackBreak sells, the smart contract calls WAX RNG once more, uses the new random number to shuﬄe slots once more and then posts the final slot order on-chain. All this happens before the pack is opened
-	Once that final shuﬄe is complete and the final slot order posted on chain, then the pack will be sent to its respective opener (or dp account for Funko packs) and opened. The order in which the NFTs are received by our smart contract determines the order they are issued to the slots. Some packs return bonus NFTs, fillers, or otherwise may return more NFTs than there are slots for that pack, in this case those bonus NFTs are issued following the same policy above, in the order they are received, and will start at the slot ordered number #1, and then move on to slot #2, etc. until all bonus NFTs are issued.
-	Each time a PackBreak opens and issues the assets according to the above policies, the next pack will be automatically listed from the queue list, when available.
-	Front-end features include a marketplace like interface where users can buy or sell NFTs they win in PackBreaks. Users can search all past PackBreaks and view all the details of each break, including the slots and all the NFTs that were issued. Users can also search all NFTs that were pulled across any collection or pack, view all asset details, list their asset for sale, or buy from the list of lowest listed assets
-	We planned to have this new PackBreaks launched before the within report was due, but it will be launched after final testing and integration within a week from this report

**Next milestones:**
-	Continue adding support for existing packs and for new packs as they launch
-	Add packs from Atomichub’s and NFTHive’s pack openers
-	Full Medium instructional writeup introducing all the features and ways to use PackBreaks
-	Marketing
