### **Product 1: WAX Blockchain CPU Rental Service - [cpu.rent](https://cpu.rent/)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that CPU Rental product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. CPU.rent has performed without issue since the last report.

**Progress:**
-	The only CPU rental service adding utility to other tokens by accepting payment in WAX, BRWL, TLM, TACO, or DUST.
-	Since release cpu.rent has performed ﬂawlessly and been growing in popularity and is funded with more WAX.
-	Registered with boost.wax to cover CPU costs for users of cpu.rent and our other products.

**Next milestones:**
-	Add support for other tokens as required or requested.

**Metrics:**
-	4,418+ CPU rentals to date.

### **Product 2: Waxstash Marketplace. [https://waxstash.com](https://waxstash.com) | [https://waxstash.io](https://waxstash.io)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that Packbreaks product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Packbreaks.io is currently live.

**Progress:**
- It’s become clear that Waxstash as a market volume has dropped below a minimum viable threshold, and has been decaying. Therefore, we are working on a fresh ranking/market website that will focus on top projects with real-world utility, such as those with physical redemptions and P2E gaming opportunities. This will be a new product to be announced in future reports that will be geared more towards Discord bot integration and a standalone database tracking competitive set rankings. We expect when the new ranking/market is released Waxstash will be fully retired.

**Next milestones:**
- Prepare to make room for the Rankings Market.

**Metrics:**
- Nominal.
