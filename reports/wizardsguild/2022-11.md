**Wizard's Guild Updates – November 2022**

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**


### **Product 1: WAX Blockchain CPU Rental Service - [cpu.rent](https://cpu.rent/)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that CPU Rental product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. CPU.rent has performed without issue since the last report.

**Progress:**
-	The only CPU rental service adding utility to other tokens by accepting payment in WAX, BRWL, TLM, TACO, or DUST

**Next milestones:**
-	Add support for other tokens as required or requested
-	Seeking feedback from the community regarding whether we should add support for SEST, CBIT, and AUREUS

**Metrics:**
-	6,333+ CPU rentals to date.

### **Product 2: Waxstash Marketplace. [https://waxstash.com](https://waxstash.com) | [https://waxstash.io](https://waxstash.io)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that Waxstash’s product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Waxstash.io are currently live.

**Progress:**
- It’s become clear that Waxstash as a market volume has dropped below a minimum viable threshold and has been decaying. Therefore, we are working on a fresh ranking/market website that will focus on top projects with real-world utility, such as those with physical redemptions and P2E gaming opportunities. This will be a new product to be announced in future reports that will be geared more towards Discord bot integration and a standalone database tracking competitive set rankings. We expect when the new ranking/market is released Waxstash will be fully retired.

**Next milestones:**
- Rankings Market.

**Metrics:**
- Nominal.
 
### **Product 3: NFT Pack Breaks. [https://packbreaks.io](https://packbreaks.io)**

**Current status:**
Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that Packbreaks product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Packbreaks.io is currently live.

**Progress:**
-	Currently 10 Packs Supported: Pack support is fluid we add support as new packs are dropped and remove packs as popularity phases out. We have added the recently released Funko packs since the last report.
-	Recently added support for Matrix and Game of Thrones Funko packs

**Next milestones:**
-	Continue adding support for existing packs and for new packs as they launch
-	Add packs from Atomichub’s and NFTHive’s pack openers as requested
-	Full Medium instructional writeup introducing all the features and ways to use PackBreaks
-	More Marketing

-	The bot is currently in 3 servers, my own, plus WAX Community, and Digital Pop Kingdom. WAX has also added the bot to their discord but as of this writing their auto mod keeps kicking the bot and we have not ﬁgured out why yet.

**Next Milestones:**

-	Get the bot added to more servers.
-	Building a Bot webpage for server discovery, information on how to use it, and links to add it to a server.
