**Wizard's Guild Updates – February 2023**

**Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Technical Operations?**

- We're undergoing maintaince on our atomic server, and getting antelope ready on our end.

- bp, push apis, hyperion, peers have all been upgraded to 3.1.4+


### **Product 1: WAX Blockchain CPU Rental Service - [cpu.rent](https://cpu.rent/)**

**Current status:**

Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that CPU Rental product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. CPU.rent has performed without issue since the last report.

**Progress:**

-	Rentals for WAX, BRWL, TLM, TACO, SEST, CBIT, AUREUS, and DUST continue to run smoothly.
-	Over 2,000 rentals provided since last report.

**Next milestones:**

-	Add support for other tokens pursuant to market activity.

**Metrics:**

-	10,081+ CPU rentals to date.

### **Product 2: Waxstash Marketplace. [https://waxstash.com](https://waxstash.com) | [https://waxstash.io](https://waxstash.io)**

**Current status:**

Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that Waxstash’s product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Waxstash.io are currently live.

**Progress:**

-	Waxstash is becoming NiftyFLEX.io. FLEX will be our rankings and gaming portal website for WAX NFTs/games and in the future possibly extended to other chains. NiftyFLEX will provide an array of free and paid services, with the paid services likely regarding actions where users are earning WAX or some other token. They will also be able to earn our yet to be announced token, which may include revenue distributions for top holders. Details and tokenomics are still being worked out.
-	Development on the new rankings website has evolved into a ranking and a blockchain game portal. Starting with Farmingtales, gaming portals will serve as a location where players can view their gaming status, submit transactions such as ‘harvests’ or ‘claims’, manage, buy, and sell game inventory.
-	The original plan to create a ranking site is still being developed and will exist alongside the gaming portals, however, in my opinion at this time Wax Blockchain will be better served with gaming/earning tools for players and thus those eﬀorts are being prioritized over rankings.
-	The Farmingtales team has indicated to me that once these portals are ready, they would like to market it to their users as a supported tool for them. In addition, the team has expressed an interest in working with me to support their other games as well.


**Next milestones:**

- Farmingtales gaming portal launch.

**Metrics:**

- Nominal.
 
### **Product 3: NFT Pack Breaks. [https://packbreaks.io](https://packbreaks.io)**

Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that Packbreaks product points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full. Packbreaks.io is currently live.

**Progress:**

-	Currently 13 Packs Supported.
-	Since the last report we added support for Farmingtales Seeds Boxes and Mining Architect large and truck packs.

**Next milestones:**

-	Adding support for packs as the market dictates.

Nifty Wizards and DUST share the same Firebase infrastructure. Between the two projects, it was accessed approximately 223,000 times per day over the last 30 days making the 45-day total approximately 10 million.

Two new drops and two new blends are scheduled to begin on March 3rd.

**New Information:**

Nifty Wizards' Castle bot has been upgraded and now reports which NFT's were produced in a given timeframe. Also, a second castle has begun producing NFT's - the Beer Castle. If a player's castle is chosen by the bot, it then verifies the number of Babies owned by that player and mints the coresponding number of Beer NFT's into the player's wallet. Beer NFT's will become deflationary soon with the release of Rare Beer packs and Rare Beer blends.
