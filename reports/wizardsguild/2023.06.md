### **Product 2: ChainFLEX.io [https://chainflex.io](https://chainflex.io)

**Current status:**

Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and WIzardsguild it is intended that NiFTyLIFE’s points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full.

**Progress:**

Previously in guild reports this product was referred to as NiftyFLEX.io, however before launching this product 3 weeks ago it was decided to change the name and host it at the URL ChainFLEX.io.
Our marketplace product Waxstash is retired and ChainFLEX is live. ChainFLEX is a set of blockchain gaming and ranking tools, two new tokens (FLEX & TXS), and subscription & access models enforced by smart contract.

ChainFLEX is built with sveltekit and every aspect of the website and gaming tools is reactive and is lightning fast.

**Current Tools**

Full tool set for Farmingtales unity game. Users can manage, harvest, craft, track and complete game tasks, and more. The creators of Farmingtales were consulted and we received permission to build all the tools. Users save hours of time managing their farms with ChainFLEX.
Users can click on ingredients in Farmingtales tools and if they do not own it are shown market listings for the lowest price available.
Packbreaks and CPU.rent panels exist but currently only link out to their respective websites. Tools for those services are being built into ChainFLEX.
TXS and FLEX tokens are live and markets have been created for each on Alcor. The tokens are used to enforce access to ChainFLEX tools that scales with a users volume. So low volume users can use tolls for free or very little cost, while high volume users pay more in accordance with their usage.
Smart contract enforces multiple tiers of token purchases, access, and subscriptions to ChainFLEX tools. Users with nominal volume can use the tools for free, as their usage scales up so does the cost of TXS or FLEX token they need in order to continue their use. Heavy users may choose to pay a flat fee for unlimited monthly use. Users manage their FLEX Wallet on the website, and may buy TXS or FLEX, or pay the unlimited subscription. Contracts also keep track of several things, such as the total amount a user has spent for the month, and as they spend more they enter higher tiers where they can buy TXS at a 4%, 8%, or 12% higher ratio. If a user hits a certain threshold spent for a month then contracts will allow complimentary unlimited access for the remainder.

**Future Tools**

Display case. Where users can build customizable digital display cases of chosen NFTs. Where they may link to them in order to view or show off full size high def images/videos and more.
Set management and rankings are still planned.

**Next milestones:**

- Digital display case
- Research and review blockchain games to decide which one is suitable for a ChainFLEX suite of tools.

**Metrics:**

200+ users playing farmingtales with our tools since launch 3 weeks ago
14,756 fee based game actions have been executed. We don’t keep track of non-fee based actions.
