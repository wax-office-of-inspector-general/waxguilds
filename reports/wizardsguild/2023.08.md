smoothly.

Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and Wizardsguild it is intended that NiFTyLIFE’s points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full.

**Progress:**

- Launched a brand new polished user interface
- Launched tools, a custom market, tribe, and owner panels for Waxapes
- Farmingtales team will be pausing their game play so they can implement all new contracts
and IRL market implementations. During this time the Farmingtales tools on chainflex will be
paused and likely an entirely new set will be developed as we follow the changes the team is
making.

- Research and review blockchain games to decide which one is suitable for a ChainFLEX
suite of tools.

**Metrics:**

### **Product 3: NFT Pack Breaks. [https://packbreaks.io](https://packbreaks.io)**

**Current status:** 

Pursuant to agreement between NiFTyLIFE and Wizardsguild it is intended that NiFTyLIFE’s points be awarded to Wizardsguild in full.

**Progress:**

- Due to the changing interests of collection makes and users, NFT culture has moved away
from massive pack openings. There has not been a pack break in months. This down time
will be used to move packbreaks to chainflex.io in order to provide a central place where
users can discover and use the multiple tools we build.
