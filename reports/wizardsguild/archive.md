It has been stated that “DUST is an integral part of Nifty Wizards as TLM is part of Alien Worlds.” This is an incorrect statement. DUST is a separate company, has a separate team, a separate collection of NFT’s, and separate game dynamics. DUST is a social currency that is earned by anyone that holds a WAX wallet, has synced that wallet, and is chatting in a DUST enabled Telegram room. The number of DUST enabled rooms is now over 100 and the projects and subjects being discussed in most of these rooms is not in any way Nifty Wizards related. It is our position that DUST is a benefit to all those in the WAX ecosystem that choose to participate in it.

Project 3: Niftysets

Description: Niftysets allows building and selling of NFT sets. This unique site facilitates the creation, selling, buying, and opening of WAX NFT sets. The user can give their NFT set a unique name, upload a piece of cover art for the set, and include ANY WAX NFT (even another Niftyset). For example, a user could create a set called “Lucky 7’s”, upload a cool image of a 7, and include Mint 7 NFT’s from Blockchain Heroes, Nifty Wizards, Streetfighter, Godzilla, Alien Worlds, and so on. The site then bundles these assets and generates a new NFT that can be listed for sale on sites such as Atomichub.
